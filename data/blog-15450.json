In solving dp problems, I have seen that it is easy to solve the problem recursively. But , recursive solution has so many function calling and dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are many problem where recursive solution only produce TLE so there needs a iterative solution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the following problem, \u0026quot;There is no recursive accepted solution\u0026quot;-Moderator said. \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem\u003d1232\"\u003ehttp://www.lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem\u003d1232\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eor\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/9639366/\"\u003ehttp://paste.ubuntu.com/9639366/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I need iterative as the only solution. While doing this in case of this problem I have found that it is difficult to transform recursive solution to iterative solution. I think there should be any general algo in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you help me by give me any tips that you follow generally in that kind of transformation? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
