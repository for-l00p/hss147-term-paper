It just used to store rating before rating updation and check continuously if it has changed. It had an obvious bug. If there is no rating change after contest, it\u0027ll keep running. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, it was changed and the number of contests was used to check if there has been any extra round with participation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe idea is perfect but there is some bug due to which the \u003ccode\u003enewRating\u003c/code\u003e in latest contest is returned same as \u003ccode\u003eoldRating\u003c/code\u003e.
