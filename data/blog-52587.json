Where the problem reduces to check if every number in a range occurs even number of times. I first mapped the values into arbitrary large random numbers and then used range XOR to determine if all them occurred even number of times. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter contest, I\u0027ve heard that such solution using range XOR can be hacked using Gaussian Elimination. Can someone please explain me the process? I know Gaussian Elimination, but can\u0027t figure this out. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[I\u0027ve heard that this problem — Check if all every number is a range has even frequency — can be solved by polynomial hashing too. Can someone explain that? Also is there any deterministic solution not using MO\u0027s algo?] \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["gaussian elimination","hacking","range xor"]}}
