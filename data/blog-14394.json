Each record contains value for some parameter \u003ccode\u003eA\u003c/code\u003e (among other auxiliary data). We want to choose \u003ccode\u003eM\u003c/code\u003e (say, million) records with smallest values of this parameter. How to manage with it?\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are two difficulties:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003esource data could not be stored into RAM, so we could not access arbitrary element in \u003ccode\u003eO(1)\u003c/code\u003e — instead we rely on sequential processing;\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003ealgorithm should be parallelizable since \u003ccode\u003eN\u003c/code\u003e is about \u003ccode\u003e1e12\u003c/code\u003e and single pass with a single thread will took about a day (however source data are stored in distibuted file system and are accessible by fragments of about \u003ccode\u003e100Mb - 1Gb\u003c/code\u003e so several processors may work with different fragments simultaneously).\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat approaches there are?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI came up with few basic ideas:\u003c/p\u003e \u003col\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eGo through source data and store them into binary heap of maximum size \u003ccode\u003eM\u003c/code\u003e — i.e. next element is skipped if is greater than maximum of the heap — and if it is otherwise stored, then the maximum is popped out of a heap to preserve the size. It will work with about \u003ccode\u003eN + M*log(M)\u003c/code\u003e but I know not how to parallelize the binary heap... So probably it will not do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf \u003ccode\u003eM\u003c/code\u003e itself is so large that could not be stored in RAM we can store elements in the list instead of binary heap. After list grows to size \u003ccode\u003e2M\u003c/code\u003e for example, we sort it and cut to the size \u003ccode\u003eM\u003c/code\u003e throwing away unnecessary elements and proceeding. This is well paralelizable but speed is about \u003ccode\u003eN*log(M)\u003c/code\u003e I think.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eI like stochastic variant: just pass through data and choose all for which \u003ccode\u003eA\u003c/code\u003e is less than some threshold \u003ccode\u003ek\u003c/code\u003e. How to determine this threshold? For example we can make pre-pass and choose randomly as many records as could be stored into RAM. Then chose among them few minimal (in proportion to \u003ccode\u003eM/N\u003c/code\u003e) and assign the maximum of these minimums as threshold \u003ccode\u003ek\u003c/code\u003e. Of course we can end up with few or less than \u003ccode\u003eM\u003c/code\u003e elements (but we can artificially increase \u003ccode\u003ek\u003c/code\u003e and at the end throw away the surplus).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever all these variants are not extremely good. Could you propose something better, please?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["bigdata","choice","oh, pokemons"]}}
