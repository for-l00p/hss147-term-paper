Now we will try to figure out if this is true\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGenerally, we need to have data about ratings before pleiad of Div.2 contests, after them, and after Div.1 + Div.2 contest. But I became interested in such a comparison too late, that\u0027s why I have only the second and third data, which I\u0027m going to compare\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the first 2 plots I\u0027ve compared ratings of active users before (img. 1) and after (img. 2) contest pair Div.1 + Div.2 took place. You can see a significant leap around 1900 point (margin between Div.1 and Div.2), which is slightly smoothed on the second plot\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/c6/d4/c6d4e9e34d7f7f42b1173615f674f613402afc51.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e \u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/38/61/386120e12170ba96f82815391d80ccec2628f61f.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaking graphics for all users, and not only for active ones, helps us to simply find the old margin between Div.1 and Div.2 (it was 1700).

Removing users who competed only 1-2 times doesn\u0027t change the leap significantly. Does moving of the strong coders from Div.2 to Div.1 makes Div.2 competition weaker and Div.1 one stronger? You judge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["plots","boredom","research","effects"]}}
