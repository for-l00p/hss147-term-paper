It basically asks for second shortest path. I\u0027ve looked it up on the internet, but I couldn\u0027t find any practical implementation of it. Are there any good tutorial on this topic?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote: I\u0027m asking about both SSP and APSP. Also, is second shortest path simpler than more general kth shortest path algorithms in terms of complexity?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUPD: Thank you really much for your help, I\u0027ve solved the problem! But the thing is nobody has mentioned any algorithm for All-Pair Second Shortest Path problem yet. Can someone who is knowledgeable about this problem explain it? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["shortest path"]}}
