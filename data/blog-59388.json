I have been in competitive programming for 1 year, this year we went to the first regional and I want to prepare the next regional, during the course it is complicated to do a lot, some problems, some algorithms, etc. But now comes summer and you have much more free time and you can do intensive training to prepare the regional or any other competition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wanted to see what recommendations you give the ones that you have more time in this, for an intensive training of about 3 months because in September the course begins and it will not be so intensive. My idea was to finish reading and do all the exercises of Competitive Programming 3. I also added to my drive the sheet of \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/59131\"\u003emostafa.saad.fci\u003c/a\u003e to have a problem guide. Thanks mostafa.saad.fci. But I think maybe doing all the problems of the book delays, since there are many more ideas and do a lot of exercises on an exact subject can delay. I also plan to do as many contests as are here, which really are the \u0026quot;exams\u0026quot; to see how it was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat recommendations could you give me? What possible schedule would you have?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope it serves people who also want to prepare any competition or simply improve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you very much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreetings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["training","summer","study","tips"]}}
