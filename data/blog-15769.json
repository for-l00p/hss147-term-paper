The \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_coupons.html\"\u003eeditorial\u003c/a\u003e states that the algorithm is optimal because it chooses the minimum value for each cow added to the lineup. However, how do you know that we will never choose a cow with greater value, but that will contribute less to the \u0026quot;revoke\u0026quot; heap. I tried constructing a case as a counter-example, but obviously failed because the algorithm is correct. Additionally, I couldn\u0027t find a clear way to show why such a construction is impossible. My question is, why is the algorithm correct? I don\u0027t really get their explanation. Thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["usaco","cow","greedy"]}}
