My approach was\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA number x can be represented by having the number with only ones which is less than the given number. for eg if number is 40 one approach is taking 11.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother is having the number with only ones which is greater than the given number. i.e. 111 for 40 then take absolute difference between the number and the given number i.e abs(11 – 40) \u003d 29 and abs(111 – 40) which is 71.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow call the function again for the new n. in this case fun(29) and fun(49).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow added with the number of ones take the min of these two i.e min(fun(29) + 2, fun(71) + 3). that is the answer. Also if we can represent the number with the ones alone. for eg 11 then return 2 just. i.e without computing min(fun(11-11) + 2, fun(111- 11) + 3);\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut i got wrong answer in test 14. the input is 81924761239462. and the expected output is 321. And my output is 395. Can you please tell me what is wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ehere is the link: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/kRLASR\"\u003ehttp://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/kRLASR\u003c/a\u003e.
