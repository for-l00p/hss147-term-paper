The wizard can\u0027t connect and manually opening the FTP still doesn\u0027t connect, so I\u0027m supposing it\u0027s down. This has happened before and it got back on in a day or two, but I was just wondering why does this even occur and is there a way we can know when will it be back up?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eObviously the website functions alright at the moment, but the FTP doesn\u0027t. What could be the cause of that and how often does that happen?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEDIT: Started working now, still wondering what causes those periodic stops?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEDIT 2: And it\u0027s down again and then up again..\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance! :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
