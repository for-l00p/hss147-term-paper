I have tried to solve this problem about 18 hours but I failed.I think it can be solved using k-th shortest path algorithm but I can\u0027t find an understandable article on k-th shortest path algorithm.Can anyone please explain the k-th shortest path finding algorithm. I know the Dijstra\u0027s algorithm. Also, if it can be solved using other algorithm then please help me to know the algorithm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
