I am an absolute begineer in programming and i wanted to know how to implement trees and graphs. asically how you guys implement trees and graphs in competitive programming because I until now havent seen anyone doing the basic implementation of trees(i dont know why people dont do it! If you can explain that as well?) . I am currently syudying STL and I have seen people implement them by using STL. I have read books but they dont offer code and just give me psuedocode and i dont know what to do with it. So if you all can please help me to learn implemtation of trees and graphs and some basic algos such as DFS and BFS etc using the same implementaion. And if you have a good resource for me to learn from , please dont forget to mention it as well! :) Thanks in advance. :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["tree","graph"]}}
