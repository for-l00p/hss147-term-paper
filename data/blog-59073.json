Then, I get the first K pairs of particles with lowest t value, where both the x and y particles still exist, i.e. are not collided with another of their counterpart. The time limit is 3s, memory limit is 256 MB and I\u0027d like some help with this task.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["ejoi","maths","physics","formula"]}}
