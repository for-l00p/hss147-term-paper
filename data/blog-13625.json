I need help in cracking a problem. I was trying to do \u003ca href\u003d\"https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/3214486/dashboard#s\u003dp3\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e problem but my answer is coming out to be incorrect. Can you guys please help me in solving this problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy Solution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s say number of tiles required at the end of the i-1\u0027th iteration is tile_n. We will store how much area is left in the each of the \u0026quot;tile_n\u0026quot; tiles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow for i\u0027th tile in the input, I will go through each of the \u0026quot;tile_n\u0026quot; tiles (stored) and will check if area of the any one of the \u0026quot;tile_n\u0026quot; tiles is greater than i\u0027th tile. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eif yes\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s say it is the j\u0027th tile.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI will check whether or not area of the j\u0027th tile is a multiple of i\u0027th tile. (this is so because we want to cut the proper tile from the j\u0027th tile)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eelse\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI will add another tile, tiles_n\u003dtiles_n+1\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eand repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClearly my solution is lagging somewhere. Can please someone correct my algo. or explain me what to do in this problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["tips"]}}
