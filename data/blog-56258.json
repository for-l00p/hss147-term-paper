Sum of length of all the strings \u0026lt;\u003d 2 * 10^5. Now you have to find the size of the smallest generating set for these \u003cstrong\u003en\u003c/strong\u003e strings. The smallest generating set is the minimal subset of the set \u003cstrong\u003eS\u003c/strong\u003e such that by concatenating some of its strings multiple times you can generate all the strings in the set \u003cstrong\u003eS\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr /\u003e For example let the set \u003cstrong\u003eS\u003c/strong\u003e contains strings \u0026quot;ab\u0026quot; , \u0026quot;abb\u0026quot; , \u0026quot;b\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; then the answer is 2 as you can have a set {\u0026quot;a\u0026quot; , \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;} which is the subset of set S and using these strings you can generate all the 4 strings. Also you can concatenate any string \u0026gt;\u003d 0 times. \u003cbr /\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.codechef.com/problems/CHN16A\"\u003eLink\u003c/a\u003e to the problem statement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["string algorithms","#help"]}}
