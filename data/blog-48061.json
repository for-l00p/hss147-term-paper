In the first submission I used cin to take the input and scanf in the second. The first submission gives TLE on test case4 whereas the 2nd submission gives run time error on test1 (it is working perfectly fine in my laptop). I believe that TLE is because of using cin in the first submission but i cant seem to understand why the second submission gives run time error on test1 itself. Any help in this matter would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
