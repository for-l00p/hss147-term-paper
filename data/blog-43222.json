Once I was too late, and once I even implemented A and tried to submit — but it turned out I haven\u0027t registered. It also happened to some of my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor standard CF rounds the registration ends 5 minutes before the contest. The reason is that participants must be divided into rooms, to be able to hack. But hacking isn\u0027t so important, right? It\u0027s some extra possibility and many would enjoy a round even without hacks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s allow participating without having a room. All people registered at least 5 minutes before should be assigned to rooms as usually. And after that, one should be able to register \u0026quot;out of room\u0026quot; — to participate without hacking and being hacked. A round should be rated for everybody. So, one could register after reading problems, and maybe even after implementing something.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote that hacks are only a privilege. It\u0027s good to be hacked instead of getting WA on systests, and it\u0027s good to be able to hack others. So, it will be optimal to register before a round, if possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoes anybody see any drawbacks? If not, then make this change please. @CF_TEAM\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["registration","change","feature request","mike pls"]}}
