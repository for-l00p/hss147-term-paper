Then Mina changes V by the following command: “i j d”. This means “Change the digits in V from position i to j to d”, where 0 is the position of the most significant digit of V and N-1 is the position of the least significant digit. After each of these commands, John needs to calculate the sum of digits for U, where U \u003d 2V.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eFor example, let V \u003d 1234. If Mina’s command is “0 2 2”, V becomes 2224. U \u003d 2V \u003d 4448. So sum of digits of U \u003d 4 + 4 + 4 + 8 \u003d 20, which is the answer John should provide.\u003c/em\u003e N (N\u0026lt;100001) and Query (Q\u0026lt;50001)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am trying to solve this problem with segment tree with lazy , but figure out the solution. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow to solve this problem ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
