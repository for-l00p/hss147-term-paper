I\u0027m able to solve around 5 problems a day (Level C and D) ( I spend around 1-2 hours for every problem [is it too slow? Eventually will it get better?] ). Most of the time I\u0027m able to come up with rough idea/brute force to solve the question then nearly every time I miss some edge cases then again come back, make changes and submit, then get AC. I was wondering how I could possibly get better, since I\u0027m able to only solve A and B problems in contest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd also, I was wondering how many problems are others able to solve in one day? How do I improve the rate of solving problems?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
