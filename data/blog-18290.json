But the thing is I don\u0027t know what software to use. I was wondering what lightweight video capture program I can use, because the only one I know of is Camtasia Studio, and that\u0027s anything but lightweight. On the contrary, it\u0027s so CPU-heavy that I believe if I were to capture 2 hours of HD video nonstop, my hard drive would blow into a thousand pieces and my CPU would heat up to the point it would melt the motherboard, the case and the table that supports it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I\u0027d appreciate if someone could englihten me on the matter and share a lightweight video capture program I can use to record a screencast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
