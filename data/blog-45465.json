I\u0027ve solved 4000+ programming problems overall and I got a lot of practical knowledge from that, so I want to explain various kind of educational approaches from my experiences. I\u0027m not explaining how typical ones (such as segment trees or flow algorithms) work because a lot of better videos are already on YouTube, and I\u0027m focusing on tricky techniques (and I\u0027m sure that many redcoders know about these techniques). I think that most of those can be applied for only specific several problems, but those tips are very important to get higher places.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHowever, I\u0027d like you to know that I began this channel for improving my English, so I\u0027m sorry for my (currently) very poor English. I hope that I\u0027ll be better soon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFeel free to comment about my videos here, or on YouTube.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["youtube","english practice"]}}
