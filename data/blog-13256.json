I have a quetion about the idea behind this problem: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option\u003dcom_onlinejudge\u0026amp;Itemid\u003d8\u0026amp;category\u003d359\u0026amp;page\u003dshow_problem\u0026amp;problem\u003d1168\"\u003ehttp://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option\u003dcom_onlinejudge\u0026amp;Itemid\u003d8\u0026amp;category\u003d359\u0026amp;page\u003dshow_problem\u0026amp;problem\u003d1168\u003c/a\u003e. Mine is as follows. First, find which trees each person heard to fall, then if there are people who heard the same set of trees we link them using DSU structure and at the end counting how many connected sets there are in the structure. This idea has been giving me WA. If someone could point me out a mistake in the idea or just give me a tricky test case where my idea is wrong, then please help me :).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
