The number of toffees contained in the ith packet is denoted by a[i]. You need to put these toffee packets in M boxes such that each box contains at least one toffee packet, and the maximum number of toffees in a box is minimum. You can only choose consecutive toffee packets to put in a box.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eN,M \u0026lt;\u003d 10^5. a[i] \u0026lt;\u003d 10^3.
