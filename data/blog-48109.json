So I believe this issue has nothing to do with the correctness or complexity of my code (probably). I thought about it for a couple of hours but really couldn\u0027t understand the reason why I got TLE. Here\u0027s my submission â€” \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/439/submission/21899705\" title\u003d\"Submission 21899705 by Artemis_Fowl\"\u003e21899705\u003c/a\u003e. Also, this happened to me a couple of times before, when I implemented a solution with the same complexity as in the editorial and got a TLE. So, any suggestions to improve my style of coding and to write efficient code are welcome. Thanks in advance :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
