I wanted to virtually participate in some contest, but I see that there is Div2 contest in less than 2 hours and I am afraid that at some point my submissions will stop being evaluated. It would be good to have a public answer to that and if somebody knows how it currently looks like then I would be glad to also know what happens in a case of gym contest during ongoing contest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["virtual","participation","gym","during","contest","hlp","1k rating pls"]}}
