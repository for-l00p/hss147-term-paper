I\u0027ve been trying to solve \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.spoj.com/problems/AKBAR/\"\u003ehttp://www.spoj.com/problems/AKBAR/\u003c/a\u003e for some time, but the only thing I can seem to come up with is starting a BFS from each of the soldiers as the source until the soldier\u0027s strength depth.
