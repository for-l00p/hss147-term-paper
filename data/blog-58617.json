This is a joke competition in which solving the problem is often easier than figuring out what the actual task is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis year I tried to make the problems less puzzling and more versatile. For example, almost all problems have a statement! And you won\u0027t need OEIS this time :-)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this round you\u0027ll be given 7 weird problems and 2 hours to solve them. The contest will use ACM ICPC rules (no hacks, the standings are decided by the number of solved problems and penalty time earned on them), and it will be unrated. You can submit solutions in any language allowed by Codeforces. To get an idea of what the contest will look like, you can check out the contests of the past years: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/171\"\u003e2012\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/290\"\u003e2013\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/409\"\u003e2014\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/656\"\u003e2016\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/784\"\u003e2017\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs usual, to enjoy competing in this round you\u0027ll need a sense of humor compatible with mine!
