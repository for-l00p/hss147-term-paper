My friend introduced me to \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.graphviz.org/\"\u003eGraphviz\u003c/a\u003e and showed me how it draws the graph given the input after some tweaking and scripting. Does anyone know how to do the same on Ubuntu 32 bit system? I am facing problems reproducing the script,etc as he uses Windows. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPD: I have now solved the problem. It was something with the files.
