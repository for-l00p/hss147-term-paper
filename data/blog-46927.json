The problem number is also conveying the information of difficulty i.e. A, B are easy, C is medium, D and E are hard. Also it is prefixed with the contest-url id , making it easy to navigate to the problem (and all the things linked to it like editorial, standings, etc).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFeature Request: It would be more beneficial if somehow the problem id also displayed which div it belongs to, since Div1 A is pretty hard as compared to Div2 A, but there is no way of knowing. The is good majority of people that\u0027ll always be in Div2(since beginners start from here). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuggesstion: If possible, we can append \u0027D2\u0027 or \u0027D1\u0027 to respective problem ids.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease let me know your thoughts, and if possible please make it reach to \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-admin\" href\u003d\"/profile/MikeMirzayanov\" title\u003d\"Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov\"\u003eMikeMirzayanov\u003c/a\u003e :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["feature request","all problems"]}}
