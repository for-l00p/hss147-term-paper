So you had to keep optimizing first with simple stuff but then with symmetries and so on. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI never was able to get that under the time limit, it was many years ago, and I left the USACO site.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow I thought of that problem again and was interested in trying it. I re-logged in to train.usaco.org after many years and my \u0026quot;DONE\u0026quot; and viewed problems are showing but I cannot find this one. I\u0027m 90% sure it was at USACO and nowhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoes anybody know the problem statement I\u0027m talking about? Do you know if it\u0027s been removed from USACO? Thanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
