The number of vertices is large , hence we cannot run a DFS every time .I looked on the internet the solution involves keeping a transitive closure of edges so far in n â€” bit array ,but I am not getting how to proceed with that . Can anyone give a pseudo code for that ? TIA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
