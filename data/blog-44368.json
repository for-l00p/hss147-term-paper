And I don\u0027t know why the sample tests of the first two problems will be so weak. And I also don\u0027t know what the problem setters were thinking of when they came up with such problem set.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve found that if I solve the third problem first instead of the first two, I could easily become a target.
