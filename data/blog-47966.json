This problem is fairly standard and can be solved using dynamic programming in O(n^2) time. The problem statement for Edit Distance can be found here: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.spoj.com/problems/EDIST/\"\u003eProblem\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the constraints given in the contest were n\u0026lt;\u003d100000 so larger test cases won\u0027t pass in O(n^2). So is there any way to bring the time complexity of the solution?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["edit distance","time complexity"]}}
