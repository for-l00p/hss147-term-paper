The question arose, while solving \u003ca href\u003d\"/gym/100783/problem/D\" title\u003d\"2014-2015 ACM-ICPC Southwestern Europe Regional Contest (SWERC 14)\"\u003e100783D - Book Club\u003c/a\u003e. Somehow it was night when we read it, and first thought that got to my mind: in unit network with source, edges from source to all A\u0027s, edges from A to B and from B\u0027s to sink, flow should be equal to number of people. I started to search max flow algorithm which suits to limits and found out that Dinic used for solving bipartite problem takes O(sqrt(V)E) (Wow this is the case with E maximum N we can get O(N^1.5)). Ok I wrote Dinic almost like \u003ca href\u003d\"http://e-maxx.ru/algo/dinic#13\"\u003ee-maxx\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/Y2YdTa\"\u003eit\u003c/a\u003e and it got as far as test 13 with TL.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOk, said \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-violet\" href\u003d\"/profile/AndreaB330\" title\u003d\"Candidate Master AndreaB330\"\u003eAndreaB330\u003c/a\u003e, why didn\u0027t you wrote Khun. I thought about it, and agreed that yes O(N^2) suits me. And got bloody AC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe question is: what so horrible I did in Dinic or what should I have done so it worked as expected?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you, community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dinic","kuhn","graph","bipartite matching"]}}
