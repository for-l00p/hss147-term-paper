Our university uses proxy server with following settings:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eproxy: 10.3.100.207 port: 8080\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have configured OpenJDK settings and system settings. I have configured the arena proxy settings in many way, used all the 4 tunnels, but wasn\u0027t able to get it work. Lots of people in my college are regular participants in various contests like spoj/codeforces/codechef/hackerrank, but sadly we aren\u0027t able to participate in topcoder matches. Any one has a solution to it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["topcoder","topcoder proxy"]}}
