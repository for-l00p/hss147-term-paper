Players alternate moving as in the ordinary Nim with 1 restriction: no move can be made more than once on a pile (e.g. cannot remove 4 stones from pile 1, if 4 stones were previously removed from it).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/50550\"\u003eintended solution\u003c/a\u003e is to use dynamic programming with bitmasks to calculate the Grundy value for each pile size, state \u003d (number of stones, mask), where mask represents the available moves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, I coded a simpler solution and got AC. The problem turned to be equivalent to taking a larger amount of stones at each step (Submission: \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/768/submission/33990154\" title\u003d\"Посылка 33990154 от Joe_Pacha\"\u003e33990154\u003c/a\u003e).
