If in the question it is given there are n cities and n-1 roads connecting them, solve something. The input is given as n (the number of cities) followed by n-1 roads (format u v meaning that there is a bidirectional road from u to v). How do I represent such a tree. I want a parent array to store the parent of each node. But how do I get the parent of each node assuming the root of tree is 1 always. An adjacency list stores for each vertex all the neighbouring vertices but it doesn\u0027t have any info about parent. Now if I want to find LCA in such a case, I need the parent array. So how to go about that. Thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
