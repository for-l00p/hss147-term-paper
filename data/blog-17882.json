Today we are starting previewing some teams from ACM ICPC World Finals in Marrakech that, by my opinion, have most chances to win gold medals. First to go is Lviv National University team LNU Penguins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome trivia: Lviv NU participated just 2 times, but got gold one of those times, in 2008. One of participants of that team, Vasyl Biletsky, is current team\u0027s coach (but we should note that he actually was his own team\u0027s coach in 2008 as well).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis year team qualified to World Finals as winners of SEERC. They are currently 11th in OpenCup standings (do note, however, that there are many teams in that standing that are not ICPC eligible for one reason or another).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRoman Bilyi (TC: 2513, CF: 2672) participated in Russian Code Cup Finals in 2014 and won Bronze in Snarknews Winter Series 2015\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVitaliy Herasymiv (TC: 2206, CF: 2356) won Silver in IOI 2012\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBohdan Pryshchenko (TC: 2269, CF: 2348) won Gold in Snarknews Winter Series this year and Silver in Summer Series last year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\"image\" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/93/ae/93aed56cae00515f7c8ef0d4daedeb83ba69bb22.jpg\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI believe this team has decent chance to clench gold, about 60%, while their chances to win are slim, about 1% or so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStay tuned for tomorrow as we will look at our next team from University of Zagreb!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreate your own ICPC \u003ca href\u003d\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GgqtIThNwUcL1YaednA_FQHJaDC-K_gA9Dnx_kEdZl4/viewform?c\u003d0\u0026amp;w\u003d1\"\u003echeering party\u003c/a\u003e, join one in you city or just follow ACM ICPC World Finals \u003ca href\u003d\"http://icpclive.com/\"\u003eLive\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://icpclive.com/\"\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/dc/c5/dcc533fc04754300bc34646aa5d3ffa6fe55c6d6.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["icpc2015","marrakech","world finals","team preview","lviv nu"]}}
