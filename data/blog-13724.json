These are basically for my own reference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI half-heartedly participated in Codeforced Round #265 (Div. 2) last night. The performance was well, abysmal. I could pass the pretests for just the problem A and I made some mistake in memory allocation there, so at the end of the day, I made no submissions after all. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClearly, much more practice is needed. I have planned to try all div2 rounds in 260 series till contest #266 starts. Will continue posting more updates on that front. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["self introduction"]}}
