They were pretty good in mathematics and puzzles in general. My job there was to show them why programming (and algorithms) is also pretty decent. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI show them some problems, teach them basic programming skills, but after several years I noticed that the most important thing in teaching such things is showing them why programming is important and why should they learn this. I should sell them not knowledge, but attitude during this week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you have any idea how to convince younger generations why they should start programming? Why did you start? What is convincing you to still solve algorithmic problems? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHappy New Year and thanks in advance for your responses and ideas :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
