The mystery is why does my solution behave so much worse on case 65 than any of the other previous max sized cases. Since I cannot clearly see a reason why I feel it\u0027s possible this could happen again. I\u0027m not looking for suggestions on how to make my code faster.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy solution is listed at \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/498/submission/9250377\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/498/submission/9250377\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve noticed other solutions that did manage to pass using essentially the same algorithm are also significantly slower on case 65 than any of the other cases.
