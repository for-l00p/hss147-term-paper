There used to be some great websites for Topcoder utilities like this, but anyway, here is my small offering: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://tctime.medalica.com/\"\u003ehttps://tctime.medalica.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIonic is intended for mobile apps, so it will look best on a phone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is one bug which may amuse this audience to find: for a certain input, it shows a correct but wrongly formatted coding time. I\u0027m sure there\u0027s more, so all suggestions and bug reports are appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote, the app is of course free, but I plan to monetize it using the Reverse Knuth Model, meaning the first person to submit a bug report owes me $1, then the second owes me $2, the third owes me $4, and so on doubling each time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI expect to retire soon!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["topcoder","ionic","firebase","angular"]}}
