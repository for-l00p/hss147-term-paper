And after that round, competitors who do better will earn money from competitors who do worse. I don\u0027t make money by doing so, which means all the money collected will be distributed according to the competitors\u0027 performance. I hope this will make the game more excited and attract more people, just like in RPG games.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are still details I don\u0027t work out. For example, how to distribute the money? How to distinguish coders with different skill level, so that everyone will have the chance to win money?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease kindly provide your advice on the idea. Do you think this idea is viable or not? Or are there platforms like this already? Or do you think this idea is completely inappropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
