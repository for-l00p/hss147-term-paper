I was trying to attend ICPC-Amritapuri regionals in the GYM contests in Codeforces. I was not able to find the previous regional contests of ICPC-Amritapuri regionals in the GYM section. I don\u0027t know why it is not there. But if it is because that Codeforces do not have the test data, I can manage to get it. Atleast it will help my juniors in the future so that they can use it to attend the GYM contests of previous Amritapuri regionals. Can anyone please tell me how to contribute to the GYMs in Codeforces? Is there any criteria? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#acmicpc","#acm-icpc amritapuri","#gym","contribution"]}}
