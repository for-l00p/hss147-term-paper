Can you guys tell me some tips to think about solution for Div2 A,B,C Ex. as i saw most of C problems need data structure most of A problems focus on Implementation \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eE.x sometime i can think for graph solution when the problem need a simple brute force \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
