There are two ICPC preparation camps this winter, roughly around the same time: The camp at \u003ca href\u003d\"https://vk.com/camp_acm_petrsu\"\u003ePetrozavodsk\u003c/a\u003e, and a training camp at \u003ca href\u003d\"http://in.harbour.space/icpc/\"\u003eBarcelona\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe had it in our minds to go to Petrozavodsk. We really enjoy the problems that come out of that camp. But this camp in Barcelona seems interesting as well, and seems to also be under the guidance of big names in the competitive programming community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I\u0027d like to get the opinion of people who are familiar with both these camps. What would you recommend? We\u0027re interested in what would be the most beneficial for our training for the world finals, so basically, we\u0027re looking for the place with the best problems and editorials, and we don\u0027t care much about things like bonus activities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
