We\u0027ve been getting a nonstop inflow of contests, and our competitive programming lives couldn\u0027t be better. But we shouldn\u0027t forget that that without many hours (I\u0027m sure at least 20+ per contest) of collective effort on the part of CodeForces staff and problemsetters who contribute their own time for the community\u0027s benefit, we wouldn\u0027t be able to enjoy a constant influx of original problems. \u003cstrong\u003eSo, thank you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope more and more people will contribute interesting problems, and once I reach a level where I can come up with cool new problems, I hope to become a problemsetter for you guys.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["thank you problemsetters"]}}
