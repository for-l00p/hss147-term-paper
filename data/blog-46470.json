I want to know why my approach is wrong ....Is it okay to think about misere him games as normal nim games with the terminal position changed...or can\u0027t we apply sprage grundy theorem for misere games ?? link to the question :\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.spoj.com/problems/MMMGAME/\"\u003ehttp://www.spoj.com/problems/MMMGAME/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["game theory","misere nim games"]}}
