Here\u0027s my code for the first problem of the Canada Cup. Unfortunately, I got TLE on test case 4. I was really excited after preparing the solution as I\u0027ve never been able to solve a single problem within the contest time. Is there anyway to optimize my code? Or do I have to change the approach altogether? Thanks in advance and happy coding to all! \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/725/A\"\u003eProblem link\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"http://pastebin.com/AEbpTqLh\"\u003eMy code\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
