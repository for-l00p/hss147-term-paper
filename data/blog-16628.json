When I gave this input to my ideone code,I got the right answer \u0026quot;312087753\u0026quot;. But when I tried it with custom invocation of codeforces ,I got the wrong answer again, \u0026quot;285334421\u0026quot;. Is their something different between ideone compilers and codeforces compilers.What can I do get to get correct answer on codeforces?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePS- Ideone code was compiled with C++14 and codeforces with C++11 .Is that the issue somehow? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["wrong answer","different compilers"]}}
