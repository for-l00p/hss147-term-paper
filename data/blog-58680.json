I\u0027m relatively new to polygon and am creating a contest for a local competition. I want to put some graph theory questions and have formluated the question but am unsure how to generate the test cases. I haven\u0027t found much documentation for the test case generator and I\u0027m not sure how I can impose constraints on the problem (There must be a path between two nodes, the graph must be connected, etc.) If anyone could help me that would be great!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["polygon"]}}
