Could anyone please clear me out?Actually,i read more than 5/6 resources,but i couldn\u0027t get that.There all says about subtree,ancestor,blah blah,but my memory couldn\u0027t make a sense for that,what they actually want to say.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing is the psuedocode of finding out articulation point.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003etime \u003d 0\nfunction DFS(adj[][], disc[], low[], visited[], parent[], AP[], vertex, V)\n        visited[vertex] \u003d true\n        disc[vertex] \u003d low[vertex] \u003d time+1\n        child \u003d 0\n        for i \u003d 0 to V\n                if adj[vertex][i] \u003d\u003d true\n                        if visited[i] \u003d\u003d false\n                                child \u003d child + 1\n                                parent[i] \u003d vertex\n                                DFS(adj, disc, low, visited, parent, AP, i, n, time+1)\n                                low[vertex] \u003d minimum(low[vertex], low[i])\n                                if parent[vertex] \u003d\u003d nil and child \u0026gt; 1\n                                        AP[vertex] \u003d true\n                                if parent[vertex] !\u003d nil and low[i] \u0026gt;\u003d disc[vertex]\n                                        AP[vertex] \u003d true\n                        else if parent[vertex] !\u003d i\n                                low[vertex] \u003d minimum(low[vertex], disc[i])\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
