Want to know how to be rated?? Is there like a minimum number of problems that should be solved before being rated or what?? Another thing, I am unable to view the test case which my code failed on, all that I\u0027m able to view is my submitted code. Is that related to me being unrated or is it due to something else??\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
