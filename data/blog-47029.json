We can sort the array, then each time we look for the next nearest point using binary search. After that we remove that point from the points list and then we look for the next nearest point and so on. But the drawback is the \u0027erase\u0027 step, which takes O(N) complexity. That changes overall complexity from O(N log N) to O(N * [log N + N]) which is O(N^2).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo any help here please?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["sortings","binary search"]}}
