Many a time, I tend to forget that I have done a particular problem in the past and enjoy looking at it from a fresh perspective but now that I have already got it accepted way back in the past, the spoiler tags show up and ruin my fun.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure if I\u0027m the only one finding this to be an issue which is why I ask you, the community, your opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEDIT: BTW, I am totally fine with the submission history shown on the right hand side for a problem. That is enough in my opinion and there is no need to show problem tags as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["problemtags","spoilers"]}}
