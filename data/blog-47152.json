I was surprised to know that because I\u0027m using this header on OS X without any troubles. \u003cbr /\u003e When I explained him how I manage to do that he told me I should compose a topic about this because it will help many people :) \u003cbr /\u003e So I will try to cover two things in my post: \u003cbr /\u003e a) How to compile #include \u0026lt;bits/stdc++.h\u0026gt; in Sublime text? \u003cbr /\u003e b) How to compile C++11 features like lambdas, auto, etc. in Sublime text? \u003cbr /\u003e Let\u0027s get started. \u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e#include\u0026lt;bits/stdc++.h\u0026gt; usage\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e 3 easy steps. \u003cbr /\u003e 1) Install Xcode \u003cbr /\u003e 2) Download \u003ca href\u003d\"https://github.com/vladmosko/buildsystem/blob/master/stdc%2B%2B.h\"\u003estdc++.h\u003c/a\u003e from my GitHub. The file is not mine of course, I just googled it and commented out including cstdalign library because it just wouldn\u0027t compile on my mac (I wasn\u0027t interested enough to figure out why). \u003cbr /\u003e 3) Now you must simply put stdc++.h into /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/ChosenTargetPlatform/Developer/SDKs/ChosenMacOSSDK/usr/include/bits \u003cbr /\u003e Done! \u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eC++11 features usage\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e Here you will need a custom build system for Sublime text. It\u0027s easy to create! \u003cbr /\u003e 3 easy steps again. \u003cbr /\u003e 1) Download \u003ca href\u003d\"https://github.com/vladmosko/buildsystem/blob/master/gpp.sublime-build\"\u003egpp.sublime-build\u003c/a\u003e from my GitHub. \u003cbr /\u003e 2) Go to Sublime, then select Tools-\u0026gt;Build System-\u0026gt;New Build System. This is the place where you should paste gpp.sublime-build. Don\u0027t forget to save the file. \u003cbr /\u003e 3) Relaunch Sublime, from now on your new build system will be available at Tools-\u0026gt;Build System. \u003cbr /\u003e Done! \u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e I hope someone will find this helpful.
