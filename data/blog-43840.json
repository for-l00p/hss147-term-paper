Special Coprime numbers follow a property : A number N is said to be Special Coprime if sum of its digits as well as the sum of the squares of its digits are coprime to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow she started counting numbers that are Special Coprime. But soon she get bored and decided to write a program that can help do it. Now she want you to help her to find count of such numbers between L and R , where both L and R are included.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInput Format : First line contain number of test cases T. Each test case contains two space separated integers L and R, denoting the range in which you need to find the count of Special Coprime numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOutput Format : For each test case you need to print the count of such numbers in range [L,R]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConstraints : 1 ≤ T ≤ 1e3 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 1e18\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLink: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/samu-and-special-coprime-numbers/description/\"\u003ehttps://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/samu-and-special-coprime-numbers/description/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dynamic-programming","number theory"]}}
