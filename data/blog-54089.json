Later I tried the same but using stable_sort() (submission: \u003ca href\u003d\"/gym/100685/submission/29824442\" title\u003d\"Submission 29824442 by Fred_Flinstone\"\u003e29824442\u003c/a\u003e) and surprisingly I got AC. In the statement it says that \u0026quot;for every two of them he likes one of them more than another one\u0026quot; meaning that they have each different \u0026quot;beauty\u0026quot;, thus stability is useless. I\u0027d be very grateful if someone could explain me why my first submission failed, it\u0027s driving me crazy, I even wrote my first blog because of that!!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["sort","stable_sort","c++","wrong answer","help","explain"]}}
