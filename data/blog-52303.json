The task is for each distinct possible resulting C sum the square of the number of ways you can arrive at it with that procedure modulo some prime.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis problem was presented in a local IOI selection in 2012, we suspect it was ripped from some USACO related contest (since all other problems that year were also stolen from there), so I don\u0027t really have a link for it but I know it\u0027s possible to solve it. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
