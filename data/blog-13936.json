My question is what the \u0026quot;implementation\u0026quot; tag means here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can understand there is a DP solution for it, but is there also a non-DP, purely \u0026quot;implementation\u0026quot; solution also? Or it just means, this is a DP problem, and you must implement it.
