I was working on this problem: \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/126/problem/B\" title\u003d\"Codeforces Beta Round 93 (Div. 1 Only)\"\u003e126B - Пароль\u003c/a\u003e. I couldn\u0027t come up with a solution so I checked other people\u0027s sources. I came across this one that uses hashing: \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/126/submission/847891\" title\u003d\"Посылка 847891 от Komaki\"\u003e847891\u003c/a\u003e. My question is: how does that solution work, when most values of the arrays p and hash are overflown? I don\u0027t see any %MOD operation, which makes this strange to me, as I am not very experimented with hashing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
