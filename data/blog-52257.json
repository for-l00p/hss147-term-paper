We would like to get help from the community in labeling some of the missing data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe allocated a certain budget to make some annotations to all CodeForces problems, as well as problems from other platforms, and are seeking people who are interested in spending some time on completing competitive-programming-related tasks for small compensation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt this stage we are testing the labeling platform, \u003cstrong\u003eso we would like to find 5-10 people\u003c/strong\u003e with decent English writing skills who can allocate 30-60 minutes on 3-4 evenings this week to label some data (it will already be paid).
