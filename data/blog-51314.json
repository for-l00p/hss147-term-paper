A query consists of 2 numbers (a,b) and I have to find the b-th greater element than the element at position a. Since b\u0026lt;\u003d5 I generated all the answers before answering the queries so that I could answer any query in O(1). Problem is, I know how to generate this array in O(NlogN) and this takes too much time. I was told I could adjust the Next Greater Element problem idea(\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/next-greater-element/\"\u003ehttp://www.geeksforgeeks.org/next-greater-element/\u003c/a\u003e â€” this question), and get an overall time complexity of O(n) (rather O(5*n) as b\u0026lt;\u003d5). Any hints would be greatly appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
