Also  remove the arcs that start or end with this particular intersection point.\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eNow all points which are left after above, will be my bounded region. So using formula of finding area of polygon, i\u003cbr /\u003e will find area (say area1 ) and then i will calculate area which is left due to arc(say area2) .\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003ereturn area1+area2\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs my approach correct or not?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know that to implement this problem, I need to use floating point arithmetic.
