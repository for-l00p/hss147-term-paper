The first row contains a permutation 1,...,N. The second and third row contain integers in the interval [1,N] but there can be repeated numbers in each row. Some random guy decided to remove columns from this table. After that our random guy sorts the numbers in each row and wants to have only equal numbers in each column. We are to find the minimum number of columns our guy needs to remove in order to achieve his goal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the cases worth 40% of the total points, it will hold N\u0026lt;\u003d10.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the cases worth 70% of the total points, it will hold N\u0026lt;\u003d10000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the cases worth 100% of the total points, it will hold N\u0026lt;\u003d100000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can solve the problem only for 40 out of 100 points.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease, help me to solve it for full score! :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate:\u003c/strong\u003e Solved!
