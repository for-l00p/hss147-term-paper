I find it fun and I want to share it with you. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe idea of the site is to improve your debugging skills. The site provides you short codes, which have a bug in one of their lines and you have limited time (1-3 min) to find and correct it. It is still Beta and the codes are written in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\"\u003eJS\u003c/a\u003e. The codes are short, simple and most programmers will find them easy to read and debug. I hope they add more languages soon. There are many achievements/badges. The detailed rules are simple and you will understand them in a game (or two).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe site was created by \u003ca href\u003d\"http://brainfights.com/\"\u003eBrainFights\u003c/a\u003e.
