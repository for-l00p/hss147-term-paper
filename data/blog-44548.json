Tests in the system have been updated, all submissions will be rejudged. Perhaps the rejudging process will take some time. In addition, the scoring function has been updated (its monotony maintained). Because of this, points for your submissions changed a bit. The restriction on the number of submissions has been added (up to 20000). Check out the updated statement for details.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["vkcup","vkcup2016","wildcard round 2"]}}
