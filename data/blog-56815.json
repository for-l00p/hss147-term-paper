I explained the idea behind dynamic programming and how to use dynamic programming to solve the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://vplanetcoding.com/course-2-standard-algorithms-and-data-structures#2\"\u003esolution\u003c/a\u003e. I sped up the end a little bit to keep the video short.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike the DFS video I made, I didn\u0027t feel the need to explain my code because I explained it as I solved the problem. I did, however, make sure I used the same variables, loops and formulas in the code as I used while explaining the solution to the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, I am in the process of adding a bunch of Codeforces and USACO problems sorted by topic and difficulty to the website. I have added several problems and topics at every level. These topics include tree traversal, DP on trees, binary search, and loops. These topics have a problem but I haven\u0027t added video tutorials yet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdNNY8Y8meG3z9Wy6MTzcLg\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e is my YouTube channel with the video tutorials.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["855b","vplanet","#dynamic-programming"]}}
