The trie is implemented using node pointer with 10 child nodes, representing each of the digits. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe expected memory complexity of my solution is — \u003cstrong\u003eO(Total number of pokemons * 10)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince total number of pokemons is at max 5*10^5 , memory used is at most around 5 * 10^6.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs this a large enough memory consumption to cause runtime error?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["codecraft","problem c"]}}
