There is such a problem, which I can\u0027t solve. Please help me do that. We have two wighted trees(A and B). We want to join that trees, by connecting two vertexes from A and B tree(the weight of that path will be L), such that the diameter of final tree will be minimum. The sum of vertexes in both trees N \u0026lt;\u003d 100000. L\u0026lt;\u003d10000, weight of each path T[i] \u0026lt;\u003d 10000. Problem is a subtask from IOI 2013(Dreaming, 1 day).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#ioi","#2013","#trees"]}}
