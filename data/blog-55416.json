In my WA submission I choose to break when the distance from the origin of the cell I am traversing is smaller or equal to the distance of the point of the front of the queue plus 1. In my accepted solution I choose to break when the distance from the origin of the cell I am traversing is smaller or equal to the distance of the point of the front of the queue. But I can\u0027t understand why my first solution fail. Can anyone give me the explanation ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCorrect : \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/877/submission/31687084\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/877/submission/31687084\u003c/a\u003e WA: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/877/submission/31686998\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/877/submission/31686998\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
