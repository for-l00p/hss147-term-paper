I solved such a shared problem during a contest and later I wanted to read my code again. So I went to \u0026quot;PROBLEMSET\u0026quot; and chose that task (it was green!). But page with statement didn\u0027t show my submission. It seems my submission is attached to div1-version of problem and \u0026quot;PROBLEMSET\u0026quot; page shows shared tasks as div2 ones. It is a bit uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater I found my code (I chose right d1-contest from list of all contests) and from curiosity I tried to submit my solution by page with d2-version. As I\u0027ve expected it gave me +1 to problemset standings (number of solved tasks).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think it is something to be fixed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBtw. thanks Mike (and other people working on CF) for such an amazing platform! :) \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["bug","codeforces","bug report"]}}
