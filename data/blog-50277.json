First off, I just wanted to ask if this problem is solvable using segment trees: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/52/C\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/52/C\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wrote a solution which uses segment trees but it gives me TLE on test 8. Can you please give me a hint at least? That would be quite helpful. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is the code: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/52/submission/24460216\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/52/submission/24460216\u003c/a\u003e Thanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["segment trees","rmq","tle","data structure"]}}
