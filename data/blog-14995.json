As i have read in many forums it is possible to solve the maximum-subarray-sum problem (usually solved by Kadane\u0027s algorithm) using Segment Trees, then obviously the question came by, is it possible to solve the maximum-submatrix-sum problem using Segment Trees? , i think it should be faster than the O(N^3) adapted Kadane\u0027s algorithm. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e:) just a question trying to learn more\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["segment trees","kadane","question"]}}
