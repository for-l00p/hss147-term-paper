We must answer \u0026quot;YES\u0026quot; if a permutation of the subarray from arr[i] to arr[i+L-1] differs from a permutation of the subarray from arr[j] to arr[j+L-1] in at most D places, and \u0026quot;NO\u0026quot; otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis sounds like an offline segment tree problem, but I am not sure how to start implementing it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan someone give me some hints to get me started and moving in the right direction?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease help, and thanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUPD: Just for the sake of it, I tried submitting a naive N^2 solution, which didn\u0027t make it in the time limit of 2 seconds, as expected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUPD2: Original problem statement is \u003ca href\u003d\"https://pastebin.com/AWh51K8M\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["offline query","segment tree","permutation","subarray"]}}
