I could not come up with a solution for the same.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven an array A of N elements, you have top tell the minimum number of operations to sort the array. An operation is defined as follows: \u003cbr /\u003e 1. Take two indexes [l, r] in the array. \u003cbr /\u003e 2. Reverse the array elements (A[l], A[l+1], ..., A[r]). \u003cbr /\u003e E.g. : A \u003d [3, 2, 1, 4] \u003cbr /\u003e Ans \u003d 1. \u003cbr /\u003e Explanation: l \u003d 0, r\u003d 2. Flip [3, 2, 1] \u003d\u003d\u0026gt; A \u003d [1,2,3,4]\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch4\u003eNote:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was trying to solve the easier version of the problem where I can only take a number K (\u0026lt;\u003dN) and reverse the first K elements. This is known as Pancake sorting. I was trying to find the optimal number of reversals in pancake sorting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["optimisation","sorting"]}}
