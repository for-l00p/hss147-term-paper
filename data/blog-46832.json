Also, I find that when debugging DP problems with many dimensions, it becomes very tedious and the printing format gets very messy, which makes it really hard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis particularly caused me to fail in the last round (369), since I couldn\u0027t get my code right on C, Do you guys have any tips on how I could improve?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, for a slow coder like me, would you recommend iterative or recursive DP? Which is easier and faster to code?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
