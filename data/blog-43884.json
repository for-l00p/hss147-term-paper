It\u0027s possible to take any exam scheduled to the day A before day A. Suppose that the in the final solution for the problem all the exams scheduled to the day A are taken before A. If this is true, the last exam will be completed in the greatest number B, such that B is smaller than A, within all elements in the set of exams scheduled to the day A. This greedy step translates to code like this:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eauto at \u003d mp.find(a);\nif(at !\u003d mp.end()) {\n    at-\u0026gt;second \u003d max(at-\u0026gt;second, b);\n}\nelse {\n    mp[a] \u003d b;\n}\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf this step is not possible, consider the first element C \u0026gt; A such that mp[C] \u0026lt; mp[A], so I cant take exam C in the day mp[C]. So the next minimum value available is C. This step is done in nom-increasing order of A. But I got WA with this solution and have no ideia why.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
