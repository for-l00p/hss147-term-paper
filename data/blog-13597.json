There is a need to find a number of paths between two nodes which path\u0027s weights are less then specified number. Graph may contain cycles and path may contain cycles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have found the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yen%27s_algorithm\"\u003eYen\u0027s algorithm\u003c/a\u003e which can find K shortest paths and which may be adjusted to partially solve my problem (the algorithm finds loopless paths) and wondering now if there is an approach to solve the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["graphs"]}}
