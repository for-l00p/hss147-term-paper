I need your help. Lately I tried to make a program which check if a point is inside o polygon, I did it in N^2 for convex, I didn\u0027t find a brute force for concave. So if you can help me, I would be grateful for an implementation or a link for concave (brute force) and an implementation for faster running time, I know the idea behind it, but my implementation have some bugs and I want to see a corect one. That from geeksforgeeks is not correct if you think about it. Thanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#geometry"]}}
