My contests are private and I use them mostly to test problems I solve, since locally testing (especially on Windows) is very inaccurate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe wizard that helps you upload everything is very comfortable, however I couldn\u0027t find a way to upload my checker on some problems that may require one. By default, a checker that ignores whitespaces and expects solution and output file to be identical is created, however that is not always the checker I want to use. There is an option to add a checker, but I couldn\u0027t find anywhere an explanation of what should be the syntax of the checker. I tried writing a few checkers, looking at the default one\u0027s code, but all I got were errors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was wondering if someone can point me to a link I\u0027ve missed, or maybe explain what should be the syntax of checkers for problems in Codeforces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
