My question is -\u0026gt; If we have to update a segment tree from LEFT to RIGHT with values like k, k+1, k+2, k+3,..... k+(RIGHT-LEFT) on INDICES \u003d LEFT, LEFT+1, LEFT+2, LEFT+3,.... RIGHT respectively where \u0027k\u0027 is a random integer provided in the input. How do we do this type of range updates (efficiently of-course) ?
