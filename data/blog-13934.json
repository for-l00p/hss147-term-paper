Since there are so many questions on so many online judges, I do not have much time to solve questions randomly. I want to systematically prepare for ICPC, practicing every topic and each type of questions in that topic. How do I do that? How should I select the questions so as to cover maximum variety and techniques? Where do I study advanced topics like Heavy-light decomoposition, DP with broken profiles, etc? Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["acm-icpc","practice"]}}
