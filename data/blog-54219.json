In this problem, the constraint for weight is not given. So i assumed it to be less than 1000000 and solved it accordingly. Here is my \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ideone.com/GVvY2q\"\u003ecode\u003c/a\u003e. But it is giving RE. I have wasted a whole day to rectify it but i couldn\u0027t. Please someone help me. \u003cstrong\u003eEDIT\u003c/strong\u003e: I used set in place of array to store weight. So, there should not be any case of overflow.But still getting RE with \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ideone.com/XayVRl\"\u003ecode\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
