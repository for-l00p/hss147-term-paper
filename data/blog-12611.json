I\u0027m not doing so good as I\u0027ve thought. Maybe when I skimmed through the problems for the first time, I think they were all not that hard.Especially for the problem B,C,D-I have some ideas about them. However, when I programmed the problem B and found I couldn\u0027t debug it right, I am a little bit afraid of it... And then.... I found the problem E is very interesting, and I lost myself in the mathematical derivation, but I just couldn\u0027t check all the kinds of situation correctly...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo as a result, I\u0027ve finished no problems except the easiest one.. I think this time my rating will be going down again, and maybe the reason is that I can\u0027t focus on a single problem\u0027s solving...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWow, how I want to become the (rank\u003d\u003d1) one... I will keep fighting!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMay the force be with us~\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["introspection"]}}
