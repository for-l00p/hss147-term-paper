But Solution in Java is giving memory limit exceeded. Same solution is accepted in cpp is accepted. I think time complexity of problem is OK!.. Why don\u0027t Codeforces have Different memory limit for all languages ? Or If it is already there.. Then I think this solution should have worked!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Anyone knows Any further optimisation in Java , Suggestions are Welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#java","java","memory limit excceded","optimisation"]}}
