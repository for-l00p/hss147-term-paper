When I mean \u0026quot;most\u0026quot; I mean almost any website hosted outside of Turkmenistan and Russia. That\u0027s just an observation though). Codeforces is one of the few websites I can currently access. So I decided to ask for a help here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWould anyone owning an online server (vps, cloud, etc. anything I can ssh into and use as proxy) be kind enough to give me their ssh credentials (or even better/more secure would be to add a new user to the server for me), so that I can bypass the firewall?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have a cloud server running on Amazon AWS.
