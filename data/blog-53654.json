The whole area is filled with grass that the goat can eat. The fence is a convex polygon. Knowing the coordinates of the place the place the goat was tied to the fence, the length of the rope the goat is tied with and the coordinates of the polygon\u0027s vertices, calculate the surface of the place the goat can eat grass on, rounded to the nearest integer. (Number of vertices \u0026lt; 100 and they are given in anticlockwise order, coordinates in module \u0026lt; 10000, the coordinates are integers).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["geometry"]}}
