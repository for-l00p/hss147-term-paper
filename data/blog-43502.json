Most times this method doesn\u0027t work, but sometimes, in very rare cases, a new fruit emerges that tastes like a mixture between both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA big topic of discussion inside the company is \u0026quot;How should the new creations be called?\u0026quot; A mixture between an apple and a pear could be called an apple-pear, of course, but this doesn\u0027t sound very interesting. The boss finally decides to use the shortest string that contains both names of the original fruits as sub-strings as the new name. For instance, \u0026quot;applear\u0026quot; contains \u0026quot;apple\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;pear\u0026quot; (APPLEar and apPlEAR), and there is no shorter string that has the same property. A combination of a cranberry and a boysenberry would therefore be called a \u0026quot;boysecranberry\u0026quot; or a \u0026quot;craboysenberry\u0026quot;, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour job is to write a program that computes such a shortest name for a combination of two given fruits. Your algorithm should be efficient, otherwise it is unlikely that it will execute in the alloted time for long fruit names. Input Specification\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach line of the input file contains two strings that represent the names of the fruits that should be combined. All names have a maximum length of 100 and only consist of alphabetic characters. Input is terminated by end of file. Output Specification\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor each test case, output the shortest name of the resulting fruit on one line. If more than one shortest name is possible, any one is acceptable.

I make these vectors by running a dp LCS algorithm that I think its correct at least I have not found any test case that proves sth else, after I\u0027ve made these two vector I simply use three pointers one on the first char of s , another on the first char of string t, and another indicating the first index of LCS we will meet(on the vectors) while any of the pointers 1 or 2 point a character not on the LCS I simply add those characters to my result, else I add all the pointers and add that character of the LCS to my result\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eheres my code I\u0027d be thankful if you could help me:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://pastebin.com/raw/ZgJt6hak\"\u003ehttp://pastebin.com/raw/ZgJt6hak\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.S The reason why I\u0027m not getting accept might be because of my input method :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["lcs","dynamic programming","#dp","#strings"]}}
