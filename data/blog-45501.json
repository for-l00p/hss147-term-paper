Click \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.spoj.com/problems/BAT2/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e to see the question. Here\u0027s my idea :\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ex1 \u003d Length of longest increasing subsequence . x2 \u003d Length of longest decreasing subsequence . \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote that the longest increasing subsequence and the longest decreasing subsequence can have at most one common element. Consider all the longest increasing subsequences and all the longest decreasing subsequences. If we are able to find an increasing subsequence and a decreasing subsequence so that they don\u0027t have a common element our answer is x1+x2 else our answer is x1+x2-1 . \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow the problem is find whether or not such a pair of longest increasing subsequence and a pair of longest decreasing subsequence exists or not. How to do so efficiently? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
