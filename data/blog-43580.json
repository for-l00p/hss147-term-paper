However, on the profiles of participants (I checked five or so), I couldn\u0027t find a rating score. (For example, say hello to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.hackerearth.com/@lalit\"\u003elalit\u003c/a\u003e and notice how \u003ccode\u003ectrl+f rating\u003c/code\u003e only returns a TopCoder rating.) Does anyone know where the rating can be found? Apologies if this was previously asked and answered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["hackerearth","rating"]}}
