The contests will be in ACM-ICPC format (since this is the default CF format) and will last for 5 hours. (But you can of course virtually participate any time you want) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince the problems aren\u0027t original, it\u0027s very likely that you might have seen the problems before, or even solved them before (and probably they came from the OIs of your country). The contest schedule will be posted shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUPD : You may view the contest schedule at the Contests tab now. The schedule is quite tight because my training camp starts at 2 August and so they should be held within these \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e days. You can still use Virtual Participation if the timing doesn\u0027t suits you though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUPD2 : \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-blue\" href\u003d\"/profile/NibNalin\" title\u003d\"Expert NibNalin\"\u003eNibNalin\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-cyan\" href\u003d\"/profile/ziadxkabakibi\" title\u003d\"Specialist ziadxkabakibi\"\u003eziadxkabakibi\u003c/a\u003e has been added as manager.
