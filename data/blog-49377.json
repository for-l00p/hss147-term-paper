I figured out how to do it: 1. I will check among all possible quasibinary numbers which provides me least numbers of such numbers whose sum is equal to n(the given number) 2. I memoize the solution. Basic DP stuff. 3. In all my tests I got correct answer for number of numbers but I can\u0027t construct the solution i.e actual numbers which form the solution. Can you help me with this. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have submitted my solution \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/538/submission/23388905\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#dp","constructive algorithms"]}}
