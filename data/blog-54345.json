On the occasion of the city\u0027s anniversary, a decision was taken to pave the Square with square granite flagstones. Each flagstone is of the size a × a.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat is the least number of flagstones needed to pave the Square? It\u0027s allowed to cover the surface larger than the Theatre Square, but the Square has to be covered. It\u0027s not allowed to break the flagstones. The sides of flagstones should be parallel to the sides of the Square. \u003cstrong\u003eINPUT\u003c/strong\u003e The input contains three positive integer numbers in the first line: n,  m and a (1 ≤  n, m, a ≤ 109).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOUTPUT\u003c/strong\u003e Write the needed number of flagstones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEXAMPLES\u003c/strong\u003e input 6 6 4 output 4\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have to find the minimum number of flagstones that cover the rectangle.Acording to me,  Area of the rectangle\u003dn*m  1 flagstone covers the area of a*a,  Since we are not allowed to break the flagstones  Minimum number of flagstones that cover the entire area should be ceil( n*m / a*a),ie  (total area of the rectangle)/(area covered by single flagstone) But I\u0027m getting WA.Can someone please explain why the above method is wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
