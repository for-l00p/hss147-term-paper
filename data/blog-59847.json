For example, problems 542 through 553 are the 2012 NEERC Southern Subregional, but that attribution is not present in the problem statements (as of the time of this post). Compare this with problems 201 through 208, which are stated as being part of a Petrozavodsk training contest (specifically ASC 2, though that is not explicitly mentioned in the statements). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d like to assemble/crowdsource a comprehensive mapping of SGU problem IDs to the contests where the problems were originally hosted, and additionally links to them in the Codeforces gyms if they\u0027re hosted there. Does anyone have this mapping? I\u0027m curious if the admins or anyone familiar with how the SGU problems were sourced to begin with can help out here, otherwise this can be easily crowdsourced.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["sgu"]}}
