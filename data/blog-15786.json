I have developed an algorithm that solve my problem and it works fast, but i don\u0027t know an upperbound of the complexity of this algorithm. A necessary condition for k to be a HCN is that all his primes factors are consecutive starting from 2, and the exponents of each prime are in a non-increasing sequence. (Both conditions are easy to demonstrate) I am doing backtracking using this condition, as I say earlier the program run fast but I don\u0027t know why, could you explain to my why does it happen or another approach of this problem??
