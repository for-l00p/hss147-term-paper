I have created \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/50411\"\u003eCF-Predictor\u003c/a\u003e for the previous course project. I would be really happy if I could exceed it for more scientific direction. Unfortunately, I have no idea what should it be. Could you please give me any advice for developing CF-Predictor in the more scientific way. May you know any other service (not too easy \u0026amp; not too hard for diploma project) that could make codeforces better? :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank in advance\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["diploma project","cf-predictor","app development"]}}
