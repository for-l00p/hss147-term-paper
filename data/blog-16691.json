I solved all the tasks at 293 and it passed 2 hours since the contest\u0027s end, all the results are published, but i still got \u0026quot;Running on test 49\u0026quot; status on C (only in my \u0026quot;submissions\u0026quot; tab). If you open the submission window you can see that it\u0027s passed 49-th and even 50 and 51-th tests but the status are not updated. Also in \u0026quot;Contests\u0026quot; tab it says that i solved 4 and am 14-th though with 4 problems i\u0027d be like 100-th.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would like to know if it\u0027s a bug. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/519/submission/10064218\"\u003eSubmission\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
