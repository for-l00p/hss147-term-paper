As i have seen in pseudocodes they say for a u-v edge , we check if we can shorter the distance or not (if(Distance[u]+Weight[u-v]\u0026lt;Distance[v] then Distance[v]\u003dDistance[u]+Weight[u-v]) but my question is when edges are bidirectional are we supposed to check for the other endpoint or one is enough ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["shortest path","bellmanford","algorithm"]}}
