I have heard that some people were able to pass \u0026quot;naive\u0026quot; algorithm under time limit with the help of optimizations. I would love if everyone here would share their optimization codes and explain meaning of every line so that \u0026quot;everyone\u0026quot; would get it in C++. I only know ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0); Also I don\u0027t understand the meaning of these lines. Thanks for your efforts. :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["programming","competitve programming","optimization","c++ 11"]}}
