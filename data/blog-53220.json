The problem is you have to find a path between two nodes in an undirected tree. And the approach i came up with is find the lca of node \u0027A\u0027 and \u0027B\u0027 and then print the path from node \u0027A\u0027 to lca and then from the next node after lca to node \u0027B\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/0e/28/0e284b58bc79a0d08b6af44a5676d70eae2282cb.jpg\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example consider the above picture, you can see that  node A \u003d 8,  node B \u003d 10,\u003cbr /\u003e lca(A, B) \u003d 4. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can find lca(A, B) using sparse table but the problem is how can i find path from node \u0027A\u0027 to lca and the path from node \u0027B\u0027 to lca. I know i can do a dfs for finding the path but thats brute force i need a more efficient solution. What i want to say is that i need an algorithm that will only check path 8-\u0026gt;1-\u0026gt;2-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;4-\u0026gt;5 and not 4-\u0026gt;7-\u0026gt;10 if  node A \u003d 8,  node B \u003d 9 \u0026amp;  lca(A, B) \u003d 5. Can i use dfs ordering? If so then how? Thanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["lca","dfs"]}}
