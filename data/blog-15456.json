For all the test cases ( both the numbers \u0026lt;\u003d 100000) , the answer is \u0026lt;\u003d2. Is it always true? In other words, Is it always true that For any two numbers x \u0026amp; y, x\u0026lt;y , we can find a \u0026amp; b such that x\u0026lt;a\u0026lt;b\u0026lt;y and gcd(x,a) \u003d gcd(a,b)\u003dgcd(b,y)\u003d1 ? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["number theory"]}}
