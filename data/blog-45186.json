When i first started this job, i was thinking i\u0027ll be very successful if I study enough and enthusiastic. I spent so much time on learning this thing.I sacrificed my hobbies and sleep over code. However, it was too late i understood my epic failure. I cannot remember what i studied, cannot think practically, cannot solve problems properly.
