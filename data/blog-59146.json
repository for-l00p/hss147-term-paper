For this I thought of a basic graph question. In order to generate the test cases , I used random number generator. But I am not able to generate the output as when I try to run it on my computer it runs out of memory.Can anyone please tell how to run programs with big inputs and outputs? And also is there any other effective way of generating the test cases except the random number generator? Thanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
