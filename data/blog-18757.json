I realized that I have to solve problems to be good at this. Now what happened to me repeatedly is this-\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e1. Be in a virtual or actual contest.\n2. Try hard.\n3. I can only solve 1 or 2.\n4. Contest ends.\n5. Check the editorial for unsolved ones.\n6.  **Can not understand the idea or feel confident enough to solve the problem.**\n7. Try an hour to understand.\n8. Leave it...\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have found that for this reason I an still green and I have to write this. In case of practice problems I take this approach\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e1. Read the question.\n2. Understand and try to solve.(I try exactly for 10-15 mins..)**(Is this correct or should I try longer?)**\n3. If I can\u0027t solve then I read the editorial.\n4. Can not understand the idea or feel confident enough to solve the problem. \n5. Try an hour to understand.\n6. Leave it...\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem is similar here also. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eMy question is\u003c/h4\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e1. What should I do? I mean is there any strategy to overcome this (How can I understand editorials)?\n2. How much time should I give to a practice problem?\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am trying to search answer of these questions for probably a year. I want to grow but how can I if I don\u0027t understand the editorials? I want to know the art and be a \u0026quot;RED\u0026quot; someday. [For example I can\u0027t understand the #509C and #156C (div2) problems editorials..these are only the last 2 of hundreds of editorial I have read in a year.]\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["problem solving","editorial","practice","upsolving"]}}
