Last week I was training in A2 with random problems selected from all judges and I found this problem: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?option\u003donlinejudge\u0026amp;page\u003dshow_problem\u0026amp;problem\u003d4058\"\u003ehttps://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?option\u003donlinejudge\u0026amp;page\u003dshow_problem\u0026amp;problem\u003d4058\u003c/a\u003e. I was thinking about how to solve it without getting TLE and the truth is that I have no idea. Is there anyone who has solved this problem? or maybe someone who can suggest me an approach for solving it? Thanks in advance! :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#algorithms","live archive","analysis of problem","explanation"]}}
