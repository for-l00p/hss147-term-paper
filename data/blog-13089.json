Here\u0027s my code: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/447/submission/7148685\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/447/submission/7148685\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy approach is the following.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e- Count the length of the sequence (left \u0026amp; right) for each index i until (n-1), while i start \n  from 0 and n is the number of element.\n- i know that the result of the sequence would be like this (something that increasing) + \n  element that can be changed + (something that increasing).\n- After that i just count the length of the sequence for each index.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eI get WA on the 5th test, it\u0027s too big for me to analyse it (I can\u0027t even get access to the full example), nor I can get access to the full test data. Would this approach satisfy the time limits, and where is my mistake?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dp"]}}
