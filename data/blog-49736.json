(Let us say n is quite small, \u0026lt;\u003d10)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, I am thinking is there an easy way to solve this as the constraints on j are quite high (of the order of 10^4) and it would be impossible to generate all possible n-tuples which sum upto j for each value of j. Could it possibly be done by matrix exponentiation?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dynamic programming","#matrix exponentialtion","combinatorics"]}}
