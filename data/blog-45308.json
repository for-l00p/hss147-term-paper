When I opened a problem and read it. It looked really hard and unrelated to Bit Manipulation so I skipped it and moved on to next but the next one was also quite hard for me. What do you suggest? Please provide a good tutorial on how to use bit manipulation in CP. Should I do easy problems ? If yes, which problems are easy? Please help.
