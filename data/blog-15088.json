Thank you !\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUPD:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve used the code in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://abitofcs.blogspot.com/2014/11/codeforces-round-278-div1-problem-b.html\"\u003ethis blog\u003c/a\u003e for calculating the f array, and I haven\u0027t changed any other parts of my code. It worked. Then I tried the idea using my monotonic queue class, which I\u0027ve written before(and I know that that code is correct because I use it to calculate also g array), and it can\u0027t pass the 6th test right now. Where is the difference?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccepted: \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/488/submission/9080710\" title\u003d\"Submission 9080710 by determinism\"\u003e9080710\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWrong Answer: \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/488/submission/9084717\" title\u003d\"Submission 9084717 by determinism\"\u003e9084717\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["sliding window"]}}
