It has also been my great dictionary when it comes to learning algorithms, but it seems clear to me that e-maxx has been outdated. I recently hear a lot more algorithms that are not covered by e-maxx. A few to mention are palindrome tree, Lichao Segment tree, Dominator Tree (not sure if this is a correct name)... and a dozen more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wonder if there exists a new page that has the same functionality as the great e-maxx page where we can see new algorithm updates? If there is implementation, it is nice, otherwise, the name and definition should do. English page is wonderful, but even if it is in Russian, it would be still marvelous with Google Translate. I also tried wcipeg.com but it is not even comparable to e-maxx.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you for your time and consideration. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
