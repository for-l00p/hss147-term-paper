But I am unable to understand a statement from SY Yan\u0027s book.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSay, a/b \u003d [q0, q1, ...., qn] where qi\u0027s are the partial quotients of the fraction. Then, the kth convergent of this fraction is the fraction which have a representation denoted by [q0, q1, ...., qk].\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, lets the kth convergent is Ck. Then, Ck \u003d Pk/Qk \u003d (qk*Pk-1 + Pk-2)/(qk*Qk-1 + Qk-2) .... (1)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo far I have verified the statements and they are consistent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, then Yan stated that, if, Pk \u003d qk*Qk-1 + Qk-2 and Qk \u003d qk*Pk-1 + Pk-2, then GCD(Pk, Qk) \u003d 1 ...... (2)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, How it can be? As, (2) and (1) impiles Pk/Qk \u003d Qk/Pk, implies Pk \u003d Qk. What did I miss?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["continued fraction","convergent","gcd"]}}
