So adding one resistor means performing one operation backwards in Euclidean algorithm. That means that the answer is equal to the number of steps in standard Euclidean algorithm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt first we thought about the major problem (any two elements can be joined), but had a moment of eureka and got that the given problem unexpectedly naturally can be reduced to GCD. \u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI do not understand the tutorial.
