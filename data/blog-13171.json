First of all,I want to tell you that I searched much of time about that,before make the thread here,and the only one that I found was a formula,which counts the probability to take higher position of an other player.(Ea \u003d 1/(1+10^Rb-Ra/400...something like that.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy question is...I should calculate that for me and for all players in the competition?? Or there is an easier way to find my probably position of the contest??\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you very much !!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
