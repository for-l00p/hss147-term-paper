First it TLEd at test #25. Then I did some optimizations on it, and submitted, I was very happy because it passed a lot of tests, but then an interesting thing happened! At test #91, it aborted the whole judging with \u0026quot;Denial Of Judgement\u0026quot; verdict. I\u0027m confused because I never saw that verdict.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s the problem with my solution?
