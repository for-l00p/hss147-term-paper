And sometimes we can see blog posts from \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-admin\" href\u003d\"/profile/MikeMirzayanov\" title\u003d\"Штаб, MikeMirzayanov\"\u003eMikeMirzayanov\u003c/a\u003e or somebody from CF team highlighting a list of changes which happened during some period, but these posts are very rare, they are published like once or twice per year, while it seems that we have something changed almost every month. CF has very strong community, some people from the community do something on their own built on top of CF web site or CF API (\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/14786\"\u003esubmit solution from command line\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/16635\"\u003eVIM plugin\u003c/a\u003e, my CF achievements project). For all of us it is critical to be aware of changes happening on CF. For example this submission script stopped working after CSRF security fix. Another example I found today: since it\u0027s launch CF API had a bug that when retrieving hacks hacker and defender were swapped, turns out this was fixed several weeks ago. My achievements web site relies on retrieving hacks through CF API, so I had a workaround to swap them back, and turns out it\u0027s broken for several weeks because there is no need to swap hacker\u0026amp;defender anymore. Of course I can blame myself in this as well, I should have implement a check because I expected that CF will fix the bug at some point, but still I think it would be great if CF administration could inform us about such changes happening (hopefully in advance of course). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo my main concern is that CF community is not informed well about some important changes happening on CF, it makes it harder to do something on top of CF if you are not even aware when API is changing or some bug is being fixed. I\u0027m not sure how it should be handled though, CF blogs do not seem to be a good solution in this case because they get almost no attention as soon as they go off the \u0027recent actions\u0027 list. Also major part of the community might be not interested in these updates. I\u0027m not asking to implement something for this particular purpose, even simple mailing list will work fine for me. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother point similar to the one I discussed above is that it\u0027s not clear how community can affect the development of CF API. Obviously CF API is implemented for the community so we should have a way to tell CF what we actually need. For example while working on CF Achievements site there were several places where CF API was not enough to grab all the data I need and I wanted to inform CF about it, but I don\u0027t what\u0027s the best way to do it: \u003c/p\u003e \u003col\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003ePM to Mike? Quite often he might be busy, might not have time to respond, etc. Also again it leaves the entire community uninformed. Some other people in community might also need similar features so it doesn\u0027t seem to make sense to discuss this topic in PM.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/12520\"\u003eIvan\u0027s introduction of CF API blog post\u003c/a\u003e? But it\u0027s quite old, I don\u0027t think anybody from CF team monitors it, Ivan is not working in CF anymore. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreate a new blog post? Also doesn\u0027t seem to be a good option. It will be lost as soon as it will go off \u0027recent actions\u0027 list, it might be unnoticed by CF team. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgain, I\u0027m not sure what is the best option to handle it, but something like issue tracker should do it well. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I want to discuss this topic here both with the community and with CF administration. It might be a case that community is happy with the way it is right now, in this case I\u0027ll just switch back to PM\u0027ing CF administration :-) \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["community","codeforces api"]}}
