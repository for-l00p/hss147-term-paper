The system should satisfy the following conditions:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt supports adding problems manually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt can judge the submissions according to OI style (The number of points a submission gains is directly proportional to the number of test cases it passes).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eSPOJ used to be the best choice for a long period of time. However, its limitation in the number of test cases (at most 16) makes it no longer be a perfect choice. Codeforces, as far as I know, despite allowing local training, does not provide the OI judging service.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you give me any advice on where I should host the judging service? Writing my own server, of course, is not my expected answer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP/s: Today is Jan 11th now.
