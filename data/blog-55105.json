The answer (for that digit) is computed by \u003ccode\u003eF(B) - F(A - 1)\u003c/code\u003e. Without dynamic programming techniques, it solves the problem, despiste the slowness. Some problems that i solved earlier got accepted with the following states: \u003ccode\u003edp[current_digit][number_formed][leftmost_lo][leftmost_hi]\u003c/code\u003e, but in this particular problem, the number formed might be to high.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dynamic programming","counting","digit dp"]}}
