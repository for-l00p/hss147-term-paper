I just want to look at some AC solution, but again, because of the popup loading thing, it either takes 30 seconds to load, OR crashes the browser tab! This is even on the latest chrome. I suggest that the popup be eliminated, and go straight to the web page that actually contains the code. \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-admin\" href\u003d\"/profile/MikeMirzayanov\" title\u003d\"Штаб, MikeMirzayanov\"\u003eMikeMirzayanov\u003c/a\u003e, I hope you can consider this proposal. If anyone has similar experience or further suggestion please post. Thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
