Hence, I think that there must be some way to avoid the direct enumeration of all possible Hamiltonian circuits like what \u003ca href\u003d\"https://github.com/MaskRay/HackerRank/blob/master/bytelandian-tours.cc\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e solution did. I am unable to comprehend the author\u0027s logic though.
