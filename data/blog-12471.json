We also often have to draw graphs. And maybe some people already know that there is tool for visualization of graphs called GraphViz, which parses the DOT code into visual image with the corresponding graph.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eExample of a graph that can be obtained using graphviz â€” compressed suffix tree for the string abaabbaaa. Yes, the graph contains a small mistake, but it is not important :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/e4/45/e4456eef1399a900501ba426463e3cec93538d8a.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, actually, to the subject.
