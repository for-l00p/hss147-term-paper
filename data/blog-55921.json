For example segment tree is a good example to adapt real time data changes, unfortunately with minimal applications. On the other hand, maximizing tasks in scheduler algorithm requires full set of (startTime, endTime) dataset before start processing. What if new tasks arrives on real time and we need to maximize the tasks. I wonder if there are some kinds of data structure/algorithm which works best to process such kind of real time processing including but not limited to task scheduler example.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#data structure","#algorithms","realtime","online"]}}
