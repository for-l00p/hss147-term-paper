That\u0027s why I decided to attend Applied Mathematics next year ( I\u0027m still 16 years old :( ). What I would like to know is how much competitive programming helps in a graduation/career of an applied mathematician once I got to know \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-red\" href\u003d\"/profile/GlebsHP\" title\u003d\"Гроссмейстер GlebsHP\"\u003eGlebsHP\u003c/a\u003e and noticed his incredible achievements. Do the competitive programming\u0027s algorithms appears into the researchs or they don\u0027t but the importance is in the development of the logical thinking...?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSorry for my bad English.
