Only one team could solve it. In this problem, you have to find a valid \u003cstrong\u003eclosed\u003c/strong\u003e tour in a n*m board ( 1\u0026lt; \u003d n,m \u0026lt;\u003d 200) where two consecutive cells in your path must have a Manhattan distance of 2 or 3 and every cell is visited exactly once. Or you should output that no valid tour is possible. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis seemed to me like a variation of a knight\u0027s tour problem on an arbitrary sized chessboard where you\u0027re allowed to move like a chess knight. I\u0027ve read up a bit on \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour#Warnsdorf.27s_rule\"\u003eWarnsdorf\u0027s rule\u003c/a\u003e . I was not sure if it would help here. Nonetheless I implemented the rule in \u003ca href\u003d\"https://pastebin.com/GudQwzD8\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e code to check its efficiency for this problem. As expected, it doesn\u0027t even work for boards like 7*7. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo does anyone have any idea how this problem can be solved ? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
