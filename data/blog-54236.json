I have seen this being done in a lot editorials recently i have become intrested in this also. Being more specific proving greedy solution would work or dp solution would work. Also, sometimes i have seen that people point specific test_cases for disproving a specific solution won\u0027t work. I wanted to know how to you guys come up with such test_cases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["coding competition","proof","test case"]}}
