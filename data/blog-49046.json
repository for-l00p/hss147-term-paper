I have a problem with computing the size (number of the nodes) of the largest SCC of a given graph: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/predownloaded/97/d6/97d6203e45199e310ddef420c28c567917a89061.jpg\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/predownloaded/97/d6/97d6203e45199e310ddef420c28c567917a89061.jpg\u003c/a\u003e. Problem statement is: Given a directed graph. Compute the size (number of the nodes) of its largest SCC. I want to use Kosaraju\u0027s algo (calling DFS on the given graph and its inverted version). What happens if I first go to node root-\u0026gt;a-\u0026gt;b and mark node \u0026quot;b\u0026quot; as visited, then go root-\u0026gt;c-\u0026gt;...? Since \u0026quot;b\u0026quot; is already marked visited, in this second path \u0026quot;b\u0026quot; will not be processed, right? Then how I count the number of the nodes of root-\u0026gt;c-\u0026gt;...-\u0026gt;b-\u0026gt;root?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE\u003c/strong\u003e Solved. It turned out, that I misunderstood the term SCC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
