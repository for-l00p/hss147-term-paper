In this blog i have tried to help you exploit your same existing mechanism and learn Machine Learning in the process while pursuing it a competitive way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI have drawn examples from around 10 kaggle Competitions\u003c/em\u003e and illustrated what works and what doesn\u0027t , what is important and what is not and how much time usually it takes for each step while competing.
