We know that sum of A.P. is \u003ccode\u003en \u003d (m/2)*(2*a + (m - 1)*d)\u003c/code\u003e if n is the sum and m is the number of integers with common difference d in the A.P. In our problem, n is the given number and m is the number of consecutive integers, obviously d is 1. Now we can derive two conclusions from above formula:\u003c/p\u003e \u003col\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eManipulating the above formula as \u003ccode\u003en/m \u003d m/2 + a - 1/2\u003c/code\u003e we can see that n/m is greater than m/2 because\u003ccode\u003ea - 1/2\u003c/code\u003e is always positive as \u0027a\u0027 belongs to the range [1, INF). Therefore, the conclusion is \u003ccode\u003en/m \u0026gt; m/2\u003c/code\u003e \u003d\u0026gt; \u003ccode\u003em \u0026lt; sqrt(2n)\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbove formula can also be written as \u003ccode\u003ea \u003d n/m - m/2 + 1/2\u003c/code\u003e.From here we can conclude that \u003ccode\u003en/m - m/2 + 1/2\u003c/code\u003e is an integer as a is integer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo if we iterate over m from 2 to sqrt(2n) and check for every such m that \u003ccode\u003en/m - m/2 + 1/2\u003c/code\u003e is integer or not. If we count the number of m\u0027s for which \u003ccode\u003en/m - m/2 + 1/2\u003c/code\u003e is integer then that count will be the number of ways in which we can represent n as sum of consecutive numbers. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eint count \u003d 0;\nfor(int i \u003d 2;i \u0026lt; sqrt(2n);i++)\n{\n    //If n/m - m/2 + 1/2 is integer: count++\n}\ncount is the no. of ways.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
