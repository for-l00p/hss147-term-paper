In order to minimize these human fails, I propose an approach similar to the free software contribution: a day before the round, the problems infos (statements, IOs, constraints etc) are released to the community as a whole, so more people can track down these annoying tiny details that ruin our rounds! Upon a mistake, the user who found it should post a comment in the blog pointing it out, so our coordinators can fix this. Then, the round should probably be good to go! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think about this idea?!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["bad coordination","sad","new era","free software","linux pauler","solution"]}}
