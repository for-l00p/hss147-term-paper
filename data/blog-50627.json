But in the centroid tree the path is not the same path as it was not in the original tree, as some new edges are formed and old edges are removed as part of the centroid tree construction. So, while solving problems using this tree how is it like that this fact of having some new edges and some old edges removed does not matter? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
