I will pick a topic that is a recurring theme in a coding competition and write about it with links to problems that make use of the algorithm. Examples include, but not limited to, binary indexed tree, z-algorithm, union-find, and etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe idea for this blog entry is a food for thought. Once we fill the gap in our knowledge by solving problems, there is no doubt that this collection of entries would help us in the future contests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn each regular meeting, I will get a suggestion for a topic to write about. By the end of the year 2015, we will definitely cover all the topics in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs97si/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and beyond!
