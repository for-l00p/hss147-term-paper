And the problem is for the cases like 10^5 inputs having value 10^4 each term is getting TLE. I am sure the complexity is working perfectly but not understanding the problem for this getting TLE verdict even when 10^5 inputs with having smaller input in each term works well. Can anyone suggest ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#geometry"]}}
