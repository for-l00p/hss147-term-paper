Note that both these edges may have different cost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is also a node S (source node). For every node i (i!\u003dS) there is an edge from S to i. (No edge from i to S).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA wheel tree is a tree which has several linear chains connected to S. (meaning that every node except S has atmost one child.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are given an array D[i]. We have to construct a wheel tree from the given graph such that distance of ith node from S is \u0026lt;\u003d D[i]. Distance is obviously the sum of edges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach chain connected to S is called a \u0026quot;spoke\u0026quot;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have to remove some edges from the initial graph such that the distance conditions are satisfied ALSO we need to MINIMIZE the number of spokes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think this might be a flow problem.
