However, when looking at the solution, there appeared to be a O(n log n) solution that used what appeared to be centroid decomposition, though it was hard to tell, since the solution was in Polish and google translate doesn\u0027t do that good of a job. What is a solution to this problem in O(n log n) that uses centroid decomposition, and are there any other solutions that get O(n log n) or better?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["centroid decomposition","polish oi"]}}
