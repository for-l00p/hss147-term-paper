The test case says that it 1000 rows and 1 column. all rows are empty (i.e â€” \u0026quot;.\u0026quot;) and the last line contains (\u0026quot;....\u0026quot;). From what I understand from the problem description, this is supposed to a \u0026quot;NO\u0026quot; because there are no walls. But the Jury answer is YES and is saying that the location to set the bomb is in (1, 1). How is that possible?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
