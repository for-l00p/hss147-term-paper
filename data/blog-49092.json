For example, when I tried to solve \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/253/D\"\u003ethis problem\u003c/a\u003e, I wanted to compare my solution\u0027s performance with others, and found out that I am the only one who has solved it in Java 8. But there are also plenty of others\u0027 solution in Java 6, 7 etc..., however, to find them is not a trivial task. So I think this kind of feature can come in handy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat are your opinions, guys?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["feature request"]}}
