My mind feels great, it feels sharp and quick (for my sharpness and quickness standards), after the contest I feel excelent about my performance and feel I did as well as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext contest, my mind... well... I might be drunk as well, I can\u0027t even read the statements, feel like I can\u0027t do easy stuff, think too many things that later find out to be obviously wrong...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you relate to this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy point is that some days I just simply can not wake up my mind and it\u0027s really frustrating, even for days I just want to study or train.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I\u0027d like to know, do you have some warm-up exercises for your mind that you would like to share?
