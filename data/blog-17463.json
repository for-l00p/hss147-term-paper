I know only the basic algorithms so i am thinking if i should learn some of the famous algorithms and practice problems related to that from ahmed-aly website or do random problems from oj. I am asking this because when i try to solve a problem i would spend some time on it then come to know that it required algorithm which i don\u0027t know and this pattern continues for most of the problems.But in some forums they say solving by topic is a bad way of practice.So i am hopeless here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat strategy do u use for practicing ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePS: I am a beginner who can solve A and B problems in cf contest and some times C.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
