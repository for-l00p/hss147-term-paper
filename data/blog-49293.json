This is a team contest — and unlike ICPC, there is no limit to the number of computers. So, essentially this is an individual contest, and the score of a team is defined as the union of problems solved by the team members. I\u0027m looking for my teammates in this contest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem statements are provided only in Japanese. However, don\u0027t be afraid. If you become my teammate, I will describe the problems in English. (I may also solve a few problems myself, but I\u0027m not sure).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe contest will start at \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso\u003d20161224T22\u0026amp;p1\u003d248\"\u003ehttps://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso\u003d20161224T22\u0026amp;p1\u003d248\u003c/a\u003e, and the duration of the contest is 4 hours. If you are interested in it, please reply this post until 30 minutes before the contest (that is 80 minutes from now).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is a non-serious contest, and I won\u0027t care the rank too much — the main purpose of this contest is to have fun. Some problems may be unusual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
