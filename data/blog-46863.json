However, I would also like the virtual contest to show my \u0026quot;expected rating change\u0026quot; and ranking as if I were doing a real contest. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIts just nice to know what level you are without having to wake up at 4am :). So, is there any functionality in codeforces for providing a \u0026quot;virtual rank\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;virtual rating change\u0026quot; in a virtual contest?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["virtual contest"]}}
