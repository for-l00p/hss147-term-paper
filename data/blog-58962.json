And ofcourse, this is my fake profile to hide my identity(which I am sure is impossible :P).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyways coming to the point, what do you think is the best job for a competitive programmer? Last year I did internship at a startup and I really enjoyed working there. We had to build new stuff using python. But my current internship work is really boring. It\u0027s more like bug fixing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to me best job for a competitive programmer will be problem setting. I think people who love CP go for Software Development jobs of because of higher pay and you can\u0027t be problem setter for whole part of your life? :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo here is another question. What do you wanna do when you turn 40? Software development like most of us doing? Same question for people who are full-time problem setter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd which companies in India provide full time problem setter job? I know only hackerearth, hackerrank and doselect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you for reading. And please do reply. I really don\u0027t like my current job. :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["job","problem setter","dont downvote for fun"]}}
