I\u0027ve seen that lots of problems are solved by greedy approaches, but can you please share your insights on what gives you hints that a problem can be solved by a greedy algorithm? Also how do you satisfy yourself that the greedy algorithm you\u0027ve used is correct? Thanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["greedy","newbie"]}}
