The top 500 finishers will advance to Round 2, as well as contestant who gets the same number of points as the 500th contestant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRound 1 will last 24 hours. This is not virtual contest, when you can choose moment when you start during these 24 hours, but 24-hour contest of full value. It is unusually decision. It is clearly that organizers wants all participants to find the convenient time to solve the problems. I hope the problemset we be completed such a way so how many times does participient can spend to solve the problems, 2 hours or 24, will not have a big impact to his result. Perhaps it is assumed that a certain set of problems will be solved by large number of participants, much more than 500, but very few people will be able to solve something else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(I will glad to see the remarks about translation mistakes)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["facebook hacker cup","problemset"]}}
