I think it\u0027s gunna be unfair to determain the winners and the qualifiers depending on this round. Even though I\u0027m not that good to participate in \u0026quot;onsite\u0026quot; round but I was worth a better rank Hopefully \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-black\" href\u003d\"/profile/BYN\" title\u003d\"Не в рейтинге, BYN\"\u003eBYN\u003c/a\u003e will do something due these mistakes we faced .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow it went with you guys ? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["bayan"]}}
