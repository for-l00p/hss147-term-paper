I am new here,so I am sorry if this is not the suitable place for asking questions. The problem that I am talking for is that: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/443/problem/B\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/443/problem/B\u003c/a\u003e I solved that...but I have a question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the 3rd testcase,with \u0026quot;abracadabra\u0026quot; it prints 20,because we will split that to \u0026quot;a bracadabra bracadabra\u0026quot;,and N will be 10,where N is phrase[i]\u003dphrase[i+N]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI fixed that,to my solution so it is accepted,but still have this question. If N was 7,we would split the phrase like that: \u0026quot;abracad abracad abracad\u0026quot;, so the answer would be 21.(21 \u0026gt; 20)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCould have the answer??? Thank you a lot !!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
