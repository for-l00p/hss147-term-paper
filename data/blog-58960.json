I understood the process ( u just reverse one polynomial and then perform FFT but I don\u0027t understand why it works.[ I tried to read from \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem\"\u003eWikipedia\u003c/a\u003e but talks about time domain, frequency domain etc so didn\u0027t get anything there.] Thank in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
