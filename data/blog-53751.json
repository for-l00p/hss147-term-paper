But my recursive solution gives wrong answer. I applied a simple approach explore a vertex \u0027idx\u0027 and calculate minimum risk and money associated with that \u0027idx\u0027 and \u0027T\u0027(time) and if some vertex is already visited on that path mark it so I do not have to visit it again. I have written some comments too. Can anybody please help to figure out why this code gives the Wrong answer. \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ideone.com/nwmd0l\"\u003eCode link here\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dynamic programming","spoj"]}}
