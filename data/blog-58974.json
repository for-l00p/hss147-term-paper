One day they bought two deck of cards. Each deck had equal number of cards in it and on every card there was a number printed on it. They decided to play a game in which they would draw one card from each deck such that the numbers on them are not co-prime (have atleast one common factor other than 1).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, if two decks are A and B each having n cards, then firstly Zero will draw (Ai , Bj) such that Ai and Bj are not co-prime. Then One will do the same. And so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour task is to maximize such pairs that can be drawn from A and B. Also find who will draw the last pair, Player 0 or Player 1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote: Zero will always start the game followed by One and then it goes on alternately untill it is not possible to draw more cards without violating the rule of game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConstraints\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e0 \u0026lt; n \u0026lt;\u003d 105 \u003cbr /\u003e 2 \u0026lt;\u003d A[i], B[i] \u0026lt;\u003d 10^9 \u003cbr /\u003e Each number written on cards in both decks are generated randomly between 2 and 10^9\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProblem Link : \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/college/ietcodearena/algorithm/special-pairs-5-3347a9bf/\"\u003ehttps://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/college/ietcodearena/algorithm/special-pairs-5-3347a9bf/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny hint for arriving at the solution would be appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
