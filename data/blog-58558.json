I setted up five problems and endeavoured most of my effort into the hardest one, after testing it with my testers I made the problem even harder. Originally I was aiming for a div2E problem, but after raising the difficulty me and my tester decided that it should never be a div2E problem, and we aren\u0027t too sure whether it should be div1D or div1E (partially due to our lack of experience in solving them). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo all the problem setters out there, especially the ones who have setted div1 contest before, what\u0027s the difference between div1D and 1E problems to you in terms of difficulty? Or do you just set problems and sort them in terms of difficulty without considering \u0026quot;it should fit the difficulty of XXX\u0026quot; at the first place?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know maybe I should follow my feelings and make my own decision since I am the one who know the best about my own mysterious problem, but I really don\u0027t want to have a terrible debut on problem setting, so I would really appreciate some foresights from the community. \u003d]\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["problem setting"]}}
