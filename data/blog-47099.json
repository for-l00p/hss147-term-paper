I hope everyone is having a happy Eid!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast Saturday we learned BFS, here is a simulator of the algorithm: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://algorasim.com/BFS/\"\u003ehttp://algorasim.com/BFS/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore problems will be added to day 7 soon once they are available. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is the code for a simple bfs search from source to destination. Depending on the problem, you may have to add a cost array or other conditions in the bfs function. \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/J92HVv\"\u003ehttp://ideone.com/J92HVv\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso you can keep some variables global or decide to add parameters, depends on your coding style. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGood luck, next week we will be solving some more bfs questions and introducing DFS (Depth First Search).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
