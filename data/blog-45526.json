I\u0027ve been trying some bitmask+DP problems lately, and I\u0027ve found one that is a little too challenging for me: \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/510/problem/D\" title\u003d\"Codeforces Round 290 (Div. 2)\"\u003e510D - Лиса и прыжки\u003c/a\u003e. I looked at the editorial, and the first thing they tell us is that the problem reduces to finding a set of lengths such that GCD is 1 and has minimal cost. Would anyone be so kind to explain how this works? Thanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
