I want to know if someone can explain me how to code the solution or at least what is the correct approach. I think is dynamic programming but I don\u0027t know how to code it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem statement says: \u0026quot;Given an integer N, in how many ways you can tile a 4 x N rectangle with 3 x 1 tiles? Because the answer can be large, we are interested in the remainder after answer is divided by 1,000,000,007.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt appears like the how many ways can you get a set of elements to sum an especifict number problem, but Im failing on seeing the relations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dynamic programming","help","math"]}}
