I need to find number of ancestors which has weight greater than \u003cstrong\u003ec\u003c/strong\u003e. I saved query and sorted according to their query value. I stored graph node and their respective weight in 2-D array and sorted according to their weight. I set bit array initially all zero and start visiting query array from last. Now how to use segment tree for query. Do i need to use another concept ? please help me . Thank you. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["segment tree","sorting","offline query"]}}
