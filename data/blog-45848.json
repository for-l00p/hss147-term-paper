I decided to run my solution in an infinite loop and stop when TL is almost reached. But it turned out that %%clock()%% function (C++) doesn\u0027t return correct time in the system. I printed total time elapsed after each iteration, On some testcases the last entry printed was 210 ms, however, the solution got a TLE verdict (with 10 seconds time limit!). On others it managed to finish on time, but the time printed by tester was significantly larger than what my program printed to the stderr.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs it possible to do time-based pruning on TC marathons? Which functions should I use for it? I\u0027ve heard about some clocks from std::chrono, but a limit of one test submission per hour isn\u0027t really convenient to test it all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOh. And as you\u0027re already here, I\u0027ve got one more question. Where can I find information about how often I can make a judged submission? I googled a bit but found contradictory information (72 hours, 4 hours, some else...) In the ongoing match (TCO Marathon R3) I could make several submissions in about a half an hour, and the next day I had to wait for an hour until the next submission.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI use a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://community.topcoder.com/longcontest\"\u003eweb form\u003c/a\u003e for submitting, if it matters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you for helping me climbing the learning curve :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["topcoder","marathon"]}}
