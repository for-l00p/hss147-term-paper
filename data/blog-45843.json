I have learnt various standard algorithms like bfs/dfs, bitmask technique etc and I feel I have made reasonable progress in those topics and can solve easy â€” medium problems of those topics. However the same is not true for dynamic programming.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e I must have solved over a hundred dynamic programming problems, yet when I see a new one I have no idea how to solve it. I feel as if each problem is completely different from the other. Also I cannot see any pattern in their solutions like I see for problems related to other standard techniques. I would appreciate it if anyone could guide my on how to go about solving dp problems, \u003cb\u003ea proper methodical approach \u003c/b\u003e. Please do say something like \u0026quot;practice makes perfect\u0026quot; because I have solved a lot of problems yet not made any progress.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e Im hoping to get lots of responses cause I know there are many dp experts out there.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e Thank You\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
