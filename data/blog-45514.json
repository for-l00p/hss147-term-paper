My solution to the problem \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/682/B\"\u003eB\u003c/a\u003e in Codeforces Round 358 div2 edition, surprisingly failed at 105 th test with verdict \u0027time limit exceeded\u0027. My code was written in Java, and simply run at O(n) time. I have tried many times by changing Scanner to BufferedReader, but still cannot realize the reason why it cannot pass the time limit. Here is my \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/682/submission/18551130\"\u003ecode\u003c/a\u003e. Can somebody guess the reason of failure?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.S It is not because of Scanner and not because of java compiler version. Moreover I have checked with generated input in my computer and it works fine in about 100 to 250 ms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#java","#timelimit","#round358"]}}
