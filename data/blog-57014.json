It made the question a little too complicated. I did it in a more easy way just by having two buckets S1 and S2. Start the series in descending order, to prevent some side cases and optimise the solution. Here is the logic: For each element i (1 \u0026lt;\u003d i \u0026lt;\u003d N), if the sum(S1)\u0026lt;\u003dsum(S2), add the element in S1 or else add it in S2. At the end, all I had to do was calculate absolute difference of sum(S1)-sum(S2).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCheers..!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003esolution link — \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/899/submission/33336723\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#899c","#452","#editorial"]}}
