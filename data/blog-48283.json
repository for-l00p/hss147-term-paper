CF can add fields like \u0026quot;Organization\u0026quot; and other things mandatory and increase the size of the form. I am not into system design, so not sure if I am speaking wrong. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond the captcha checking system is not functioning full correct. If captcha needs \u0026quot;1042 revenge\u0026quot;, then \u0026quot;0000 revenge\u0026quot; also gets accepted. The captcha fails to match the digits \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e(0 - 9)\u003c/span\u003e. I tried and successfully generated accounts by wrong captcha. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, I have seen useful comments getting downvotes for no reason. \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/48269\"\u003eCheck. Unnecessary downvotes of figures like -111.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt would be better if some trustable users can be added as \u0026quot;Blog Moderators\u0026quot; who could examine and maintain the decorum. :) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCheers! \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
