Plus if I loop over all elements of the multiset when set.find fails (fail \u003d returns set.end()) I get TLE as in this \u003ca href\u003d\"https://pastebin.com/F2b7xHJd\"\u003ecode\u003c/a\u003e. By looping over all elements the code seem to find the segment I want, but by a \u0026quot;manual\u0026quot; manner that is not fast enough. I only get the mentioned errors in the last test case that was created by the Kattis (not created by original author — a link I left on the comments may be useful to understand the situation). Also just so you know, kattis does not allow me to share the code straight from my account there, so I need to do it by pastebin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
