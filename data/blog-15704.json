Today I wanted to share a task I came up with, while doing a test in Discrete mathematics. The statement is simple: You are given a positive integer N. Your task is to find the number of partitions of a number 2*N in exactly 3 positive integers, such that if you take any two of those, their sum is greater than the remaining integer. Notice that the partition of a number 2N in exactly 3 integers is a set of three integers a, b and c such that: a+b+c \u003d 2N , and the order of these integers is not important. I want to see how tough the problem is. I guess some people will easily solve it, however I wanted to hear about ideas on solving it. At the end, I will post a solution if no one who reads this post solves it. Thanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["problem","partitions"]}}
