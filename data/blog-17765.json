Why a member that successfully registered in a contest, read all problems and did nothing during the contest have his rating unchanged, however a \u0026quot;better\u0026quot; competitior decreases his rating doing a single problem?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think it works similar to TopCoder system, you can register and not take part of the contest, however in topcoder you do not have a \u0026quot;unregister\u0026quot; option and if you open a problem, you are already participating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA very simple solution: If you register, you are already participating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnother approach would be insert a participate button or include the people who opened some problem.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSorry for my English, but you got what I mean.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
