Of course, the task is very simplified and real self-driving cars development is way more sophisticated, but the duration of our round is not too long either: you have only one week to solve it. Basic solution to this problem is pretty straightforward, but I believe there are many possible improvements. Will you be able to come up with some really interesting idea? It\u0027s all up to you and the remaining time is more than enough :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe authors of the top scoring solutions in the optimization track will receive a cash prize, and the top 128 — cool t-shirts with the Yandex.Algorithm logo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGood luck and, of course, have fun!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["yandex.algorithm","yandex.contest","marathon"]}}
