The task follows:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven a structure like this [ (2,3), (1), (2,3,4) ] you can easily construct all possible combinations: (2,1,2),(2,1,3),(2,1,4),(3,1,2),(3,1,3),(3,1,4)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow if you\u0027re given n tuples of length m, you need to group them in a way that minimizes the ammount of structures that you get as a result.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eE.G. n\u003d7,m\u003d3 tuples: (5,3,10),(4,3,2),(0,4,7),(1,4,7),(5,3,2),(4,3,10),(5,2,9) can form groups [ (5,4),(3),(2,10) ], [ (5),(2),(9) ] and [ (0,1),(4),(7) ]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt kind of smells like set cover problem or something like that but I\u0027m not sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
