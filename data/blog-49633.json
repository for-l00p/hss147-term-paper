It appears that there may be a problem with test data for problem L, but I don\u0027t know how to fix it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy team felt that something may have gone wrong when we noticed that most ghost participants had solved the problem, but none of the live competitors managed to solve it. My team\u0027s code failed on test 1, which is usually sample data, but it passes on local tests and on custom invocation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter enabling coach mode in gym, I found that there was a mistake in test 1 of problem L, and it looks like the sample test case was miscopied. Unfortunately I don\u0027t know how to fix this issue, and I could only notify competing teams that there was an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have the time and know how to work with Polygon, can you please change the test case to match the problem data?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e-jerry\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePS: I\u0027m not sure if I was supposed to enable coach mode in this situation, but I hope that it was the right decision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#gym","test data","polygon"]}}
