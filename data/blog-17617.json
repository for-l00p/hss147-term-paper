Logically, these two points should lay on the convex hull, so I came up with a solution with NlogN complexity: for each point A0 on the convex hull, do a binary search to find the farthest point from A0. (We have the set of points on the convex hull ordered such that they form a cycle). We take the point in the middle of index i, if d(A0,Ai)\u0026gt;d(A0,A(i+1)) then we should only consider the points A1..Ai, otherwise we only consider points Ai..An, and we repeat recursively until we get only one point. I think i have a simple proof by contradiction, but I want your opinion about its correctness/efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
