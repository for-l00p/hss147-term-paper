Last year I was a grey coder and didn\u0027t even make it on my university\u0027s team for regionals... but this year will be much different! I have now managed to become a blue coder, so I am making progress, however sometimes training can be hard and I feel unmotivated. That is why I want to know your ICPC story! How long and hard did you train before you made it to world finals? What was your schedule like? Did you have to overcome any obstacles? Perhaps you even won a medal, how did that feel? Anything you want to share to help me with my training I will appreciate. Maybe I\u0027ll see some of you at world finals someday soon :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["acm-icpc"]}}
