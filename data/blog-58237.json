I\u0027ve encountered a problem which basically narrows down to finding f(x) fast, where f(x) is the number of palindromes less than X. For argument sake let\u0027s say you have to answer q queries about f(x), with q \u0026lt;\u003d 10^6 and x \u0026lt;\u003d 10^9. I\u0027ve been struggling to find a solution, so any help would be appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
