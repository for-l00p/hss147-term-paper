So I need to solve just these problems, not all the problems of a round and evaluate my performance according to the scores (for each problem) that I\u0027ve taken.\u003cbr /\u003e In order to do this, I thought about something like virtual participation; But I noticed that, I can have at most 1 virtual participation for each round, and because of I will have the same practice plan for D and E problems in the future, I don\u0027t want to do that!\u003cbr /\u003e Is there any other options for me (on Codeforces or other websites) to do this kind of practice?\u003cbr /\u003e What about a tool for calculating the scores (Score Calculator)? Is there?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks..\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["codeforces","virtual contests","virtual participation","score calculator"]}}
