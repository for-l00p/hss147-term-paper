This is just for others\u0027 interest, maybe to help them pass the time. I thought of this problem initially because I wanted to put it in a contest, however it turned to be too hard for me and a few others so it shouldn\u0027t be in a contest:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eyou need to construct a permutation of length N. you\u0027re given M pairs of integers (each pair contains 2 distinct elements, both are between 1 and N). the permutation you construct needs to have the following value minimized: for each pair {X1, X2}, add up to the total sum the distance (indicies distance) between the values {X1, X2}. you can print any correct answer is multiple ones exist.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003einput:\nN M\nM pairs, described in the statement\noutput:\nthe minimized value described in the statement on the 1st line, and the permutation on the 2nd one.\n\nexamples:\ninput:\n3 2\n1 2\n3 1\noutput:\n2\n3 1 2\n\ninput:\n4 4\n1 2\n4 2\n3 1\n3 4\noutput:\n6\n2 1 4 3\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
