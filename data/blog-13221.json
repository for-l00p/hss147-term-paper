If instead dp,I use bruteforcing??? For example in the first input \u0026quot;3 3 2\u0026quot;, with bruteforce I would have these: 1 1, 1 2, 1 3, ... ... 1 1 1, 1 1 2, 1 1 3, 1 2 1, 1 2 2, 1 2 3, .....\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor each one,I would check the sum and if it has at least d. Program would run more than 1 second??\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
