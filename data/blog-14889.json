I need information about some persistent data structures. I need them for a project. So up to now I have learnt persistent index trees (RMQ) and persistent segment trees (some kind of lazy propagation). And now i can\u0027t find anywhere information about other persistent structures. Please, help me if you can. I need all sort of information about these structure. Maybe some problems, analyzes, explanations or even some practical uses. I will be very grateful if you explain me structures like \u003cstrong\u003ePersistent Union-Find\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003ePersistent Heap\u003c/strong\u003e or another one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.S. If it is not too much, I also need some explanations about \u003cstrong\u003eRetro Active Data Structures\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["persistent","data structures","retroactive","heap","union-find","trees"]}}
