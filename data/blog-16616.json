So I decide to create this blog.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the beginning, I must to say, you may feel disappointed after reading this blog. Because I don\u0027t have any special tips. My study method waste many many time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are some basic points I think you have known.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003ePractice, practice, and practice. I take so many time to think and solve problems. I think I do it 5 hours in a day on average.\n\nMake friends with many awesome people. I know many awesome people. For example, arosusti, kelvin, peter50216(0O0o00OO0Oo0o0Oo), seanwu, Shik, takaramono, tmt514, ... If I have some problems that I can\u0027t solve in few weeks, I can almost get solution from my friends.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I say what I do for training myself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I do problems. There are two possible order for choosing problem.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003eStart from most people solved one.\nSolve consecutive Numbers of problems and try to solve all of them.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know which one is best. But I often change the strategy. And when I feel I can\u0027t solve problems anymore from a judge. I will find a new judge and continue to do the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, I think the order of doing problems is not important for me. When I read and solve 90% problems from a judge. Will you think the order of solving be important? I really don\u0027t know how to choose order is best for me. So I do almost the problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eList some judges I use.(In fact, There are many Taiwanese judges I solved not listing in following because they don\u0027t open for all people.)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003eCodeforces. I think Codeforces is the best judge recently. It\u0027s easy to use and contain editorial for most problems.\n\nTopcoder. Topcoder have many awesome problems. Even I sometimes think problems of 250 pt are also beautiful. It contain Editorial for most problems, too. (You can find problems here.|You can find editorial here.)\n\nsgu I think sgu is the hardest judge. It contain many problems with unusual skill.\n\nTimus There are many hard contest in the judge. I think it\u0027s good for group training.\n\nProjectEuler There are many good math problems in this website. After you solve a problem, you also can see how other people solve it in forum.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think the feel between practice and competition is quite different. So sometimes I will random choose some problems from a judge to form a problemset and set time limit for training myself. But now Codeforces have function of virtual contest. We can simply do the same thing in Codeforces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t choose problems by their topic. On the contrary, I study topic when I occur a problem that I cannot solve it. Then I will ask my friends whether the problem is related to some topic or google it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI usually read AC code of other people even I can solve it. Sometimes we can found a totally different solutions, better time complexity solutions, or short solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t study from specific websites or resources, either. I will google each thing from google respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s all what I do for studying algorithm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
