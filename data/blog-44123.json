When I saw the problems, I thought to myself, \u0026quot;Wow, these problems are very interesting to me, and just about my level too.\u0026quot; So, I thought, \u0026quot;Wow, if we had a group of users at around the same level, then they could answer each others questions, and propose some interesting questions no one else in the group has seen before as well.\u0026quot; Therefore, in order to benefit all who join the training group, I have created a new training group that you can PM me to join. Your topcoder rating + CF rating should fall within the range [3500, 3900] OR your CF rating should be \u0026gt;\u003d 2100. Mine, for example, would be 1996 + 1708 \u003d 3704. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this training group, I think that users should be able to post questions whenever they want, and probably someone will be able to help them out. The person helping will get benefit of solving an interesting problem, while the person asking will get a solution. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for the time you spent reading this,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ememset123\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["training group","no one cares about tags"]}}
