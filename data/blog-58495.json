Topcoder has posted their schedule for online rounds for TCO here: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://tco18.topcoder.com/algorithm/schedule/\"\u003ehttp://tco18.topcoder.com/algorithm/schedule/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt seems the round structure also seems to have changed. The rounds are 1A,1B, 2A,2B, 3A,3B, and a single round 4. Round 4 feeds directly into the onsite, with 14 finalists (and also 2 from a wildcard round, for a total of 16, 4 more from last year).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["topcoder","open","2018"]}}
