I thought whether this problem can be solved without using any such data structure or can i used simple set and finally i clicked to a solution. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolution is very simple i can sort these element using vector pair and then i can use a set to find out the element which is greater than me using upper_bound and bigger than me but this solution giving this verdict TLE for some files. what is the reason for this. I think my solution\u0027s complexity is O(nlog(n)). Can anyone help me in verifying the complexity of my solution. Thanx in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ehere is my code link \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/D2JJqp\"\u003e here \u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease do have a look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
