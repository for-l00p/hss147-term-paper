First of all, I apologize if this isn\u0027t supposed to be posted on codeforces, but this is the only CP community I know. So, my team qualified to the ACM ACPC regional (Arab CPC) for the second year in a raw.And we\u0027re supposed to pay the $1500 registration fees (which is honestly A LOT for us) and I really want to know where is all this money going? also why is it mandatory to stay in a 5* hotel? why can\u0027t we just pay the judges, the organizers and the t-shirst? (maybe around $300/team) ? I tried to contact the organizers about this but no one replied to my emails. ACM say they\u0027re a non-profit organization. but with $1500 x 100 teams \u003d $150.000 in total , I think the ACPC committe just want to make a HUGE rpofit out of students. They quality of the contest isn\u0027t even that good. they had wrong test data for a problem during most of the contests last year which affected some teams and they didn\u0027t even apologize later.Some computers where so laggy. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t believe this is fair and I think the ACM committee should look into the this because it\u0027s affecting MANY teams who qualify each year and can\u0027t afford to go further than national contest :\u0027(\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["acpc","acm acpc","acm icpc","acm","acm ecpc","acm tcpc","arab","cpc"]}}
