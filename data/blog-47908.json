First, I determine the lowest possible prefix sum for a certain amount of removed problems. This is done with a binary search and greedy. I binary search on the condition \u0026quot;If we can remove a certain number of problems, can the minimum prefix sum be greater than or equal to the target?\u0026quot; (This is always of form TTTT...FFF). To find that condition I greedily add numbers to a running sum, and if the running sum is less than or equal to target, I remove the smallest value that occurs before or at the current index. Then, I read all m queries and binary search for the correct answer on those.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan anyone help me understand why I\u0027m getting TLE?
