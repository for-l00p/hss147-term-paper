Ignore my bad English.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the last few weeks my contest performance was terribly poor. It\u0027s not the fact that the problems are too much hard. Even I can solve it on paper in less than 10 minutes with implementation. Then after coding, I submitted and and got several WAs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe mistakes were too funny. Not clearing vector elements, not using parenthesis in an equation, displaying wrong variable, using a[i] instead of i bla blah... :(\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have a strange mentality. During contest time, I feel I need to solve quickly. As my friends are solving Div-2 A in less than 15 minutes, I feel embarrassed to be the lower ranked on the table. So, after seeing WA in a pretest, I want to debug quickly. I use a \u003cem\u003elong long\u003c/em\u003e instead of \u003cem\u003eint\u003c/em\u003e, resubmit, WA again in same pretest. (Isn\u0027t it funny?)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want to quit problem solving. But, this is too frustrating when I make same mistakes over and over again.
