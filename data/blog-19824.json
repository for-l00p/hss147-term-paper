For the tug of war, the picnickers must be divided into two teams. Each person must be on one team or the other; the number of people on the two teams must not differ by more than 1; the total weight of the people on each team should be as nearly equal as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch1\u003eInput\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cp\u003eInput starts with an integer T (≤ 100), denoting the number of test cases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first line of each case is a blank line. The next line of input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of people at the picnic. n lines follow. The first line gives the weight of person 1; the second the weight of person 2; and so on. Each weight is an integer between 1 and 100000. The summation of all the weights of the people in a case will not exceed 100000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch1\u003eOutput\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor each case, print the case number and the total number weights of the people in two teams.
