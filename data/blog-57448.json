It\u0027s quite common that I want to participate in some contest, but I will only be able to arrive late(or leave early). Besides this, I believe this is the reason some users create fake accounts, to participate without commitment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#codeforces","why","#contest","out of competition"]}}
