During the competition we will be provided a laptop with a few editors and compilers, and Ubuntu. \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.ioi2014.org/index.php/competition/contest-environment\"\u003eHere are some more details.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt home I use the latest version of CodeBlocks editor under Windows and I\u0027m really used to it. A lovely feature it has is that when I simply type :\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e{\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003ethe editor automaticly types :\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e{\n    //blank shifted line (comment for vizualization only)\n}\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, when I tested the IOI environment in VirtualBox, I couldn\u0027t find the option to make CodeBlocks do that. When I typed \u0026quot;{\u0026quot; it simply turned it in \u0026quot;{}\u0026quot;. The weird thing is that when I installed CodeBlocks on my laptop (Windows again), it automatically started doing the shifting, without any settings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt may sound like I\u0027m being very pretentious here, but it simply will improve my coding speed and comfort when coding, so I\u0027d be very grateful if someone can tell me how exactly can I change the CodeBlocks\u0027 settings so it can do the auto-shifting and completion as described above. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you in advance! :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
