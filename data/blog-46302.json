I have tried to solve the \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/343/D\"\u003e343D\u003c/a\u003e problem using a \u003cstrong\u003eSegment Tree\u003c/strong\u003e. When I submitted with the upper limit on the arrays of 4*MAX, it ended up with WA Test 10. Somehow, I was able to \u0026quot;fix\u0026quot; the code by changing the upper limit on the array to be 8*MAX instead of 4*MAX. Can anyone explain why this would result in a different answer (and why there is no index out of range (or some RE) when using 4*MAX)? Thanks for your help!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSubmission for 4*MAX (WA): \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/343/submission/19451573\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/343/submission/19451573\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSubmission for 8*MAX (AC): \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/343/submission/19451700\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/343/submission/19451700\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
