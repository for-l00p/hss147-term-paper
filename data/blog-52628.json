For example , i recently learned dfs , bfs , bipertite graphs and want to solve problems involving those topics . it would be prettier to have categories just like \u003cstrong\u003ehackerrank\u003c/strong\u003e has . one thing more , why there are multiple tags on single problems . if it means that problems is solvable with different methods then there should be tutorials or solutions according to those tags so that a newbie like me could learn different approaches to a single problem . Any suggestions and advice will be appreciated thanks :) \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
