See you guys tomorrow! \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 7th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eI spent nearly two hours on upsolving GCJ2016 final #A, which is obviously too long and I feel very sad about it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe solution is easy to find, while I did poorly at coding. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think the following things are culpable of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWriting before thinking: I thought poorly before I started to construct the NFA, which turned out to be not as easy as I had thought. I even wrote a futile DSU. Also when I wrote the DP on bits, I didn\u0027t even see that leading zeros aren\u0027t allowed. Writing code without much thinking or with over confidence is really hazardous, and in fact, it made me change my code over and over again, by which many bugs were incurred. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrying too hard while coding: While writing the NFA I tried to squeeze the index of the nodes of the NFA into 32 so that I could use 32-bit integers as bitmasks instead of 64-bit ones. In retrospect, as I have said, my algorithm of constructing the NFA was wrong, this notion was obviously ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAwkwardness in naming: First I named an array \u0027mask\u0027, then I changed it into \u0027mask_go\u0027 because I found a better candidate for the name. Same thing recurred on \u0027maxdigit\u0027---I first gave this name to something denoting \u0027the total number of digits\u0027, while later I found the base was a better candidate and called what had been called \u0027maxdigit\u0027 \u0027maxndigit\u0027. Later I found the base should be called \u0027Base\u0027 instead of mouthful \u0027maxdigit\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext time, I should think more before coding. Also, I should avoid premature optimizing, and only optimize when I\u0027ve got my algorithm correct. I\u0027ll be more careful on naming and I\u0027ll try to make my names final in the very beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTomorrow there\u0027ll be a contest among the 15 candidates(called 集训队互测), which doesn\u0027t count as part of the selection but I still hope I can win it. Wish me good luck!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 8th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis afternoon I was overwhelmed by the contest I mentioned yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt first, I read the first task and soon found it undoable, because it seemed to me that it required gargantuan coding. So I shifted my focus to the second one and found that \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003en\u003c/i\u003e ≤ 20000\u003c/span\u003e, and although there were multiple cases, the sum of \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003en\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e in one test didn\u0027t exceed 70000. Moreover, the time limit was 8s, and the based on my recognition, the Judge ran very fast. I was determined that an algorithm with \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eO\u003c/i\u003e(\u003ci\u003en\u003c/i\u003e\u003csup class\u003d\"upper-index\"\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e could pass easily. The third task turned out to be an output-only task, a task that I was given inputs and asked to submit your outputs according to the inputs, which was not my cup of tea.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTherefore, every piece of me became focused on the second task, believing it would crack soon. However, my algorithm was always incorrect, and I wasted a huge amount of time revising it. When I finally got rid of Wrong Answers, more than 2 hours elapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, my algorithm didn\u0027t manage to fit into the time limit, and I spent another one hour squeezing it, to not much avail. Frustrated, I used the rest poor amount of time implementing some trivial subtasks, which of course gave me little score.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eObviously I got a poor result, whereas \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-violet\" href\u003d\"/profile/ShineRain\" title\u003d\"Candidate Master ShineRain\"\u003eShineRain\u003c/a\u003e won the contest by squeezing his solution into the time limit and also getting a decent score on the output-only problem to boot. Congratulations!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn retrospect, it was obvious that had the problem setter set the limit stricter, I would have known that my algorithm wouldn\u0027t pass and try to find a better one. Ironically, only in the past one month, I was cheated by limits three times. The first time was in JOI when \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003en\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e was 30000 and the \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eO\u003c/i\u003e(\u003ci\u003en\u003c/i\u003e\u003csup class\u003d\"upper-index\"\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e algorithm could pass and I spent lots of time implementing an \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eo\u003c/i\u003e(\u003ci\u003en\u003c/i\u003e\u003csup class\u003d\"upper-index\"\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e one. The second time was Codeforces Round #406 when \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003en\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e was 20000 and \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eO\u003c/i\u003e(\u003ci\u003en\u003c/i\u003e\u003csup class\u003d\"upper-index\"\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e couldn\u0027t pass while I thought it could. Needless to say, the third time was today. I never had a right intuition whether my \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eO\u003c/i\u003e(\u003ci\u003en\u003c/i\u003e\u003csup class\u003d\"upper-index\"\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e algorithm could pass when \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003en\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e was within \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e[20000, 30000]\u003c/span\u003e. It turned out that \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e[20000, 30000]\u003c/span\u003e is a \u0026quot;segment of horror\u0026quot; to me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother bad thing happens when there is an output-only task in a contest. when to embark on it and how long to spend on it has always baffled me, because I can\u0027t have a basic understanding of how hard this task really is at my first sight since I need to read the inputs. To be honest, I really hate contests with this kind of tasks, while they are ubiquitous in CNOI contests, including CTSC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think the basic solution is to improve my efficiency on coding. Had I coded faster, I would have found that my solution wouldn\u0027t pass faster, so I would have more time to respond. Also, when there\u0027s an output-only task, I can have more than on it if I am more efficient on other ones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother thing I should do is that, when in doubt whether my algorithm can pass and I still have enough time, try to find out some more efficient algorithms first. If I succeed in finding them, I can have a better plot what to do next: first, write a naive solution which is pretty close to the improved one, and if it won\u0027t pass, change it into the improved one. This can prevent me both from wasting time on implementing complicated over efficient algorithms and becoming frustrated when my simple but less efficient algorithms won\u0027t pass.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTactics are very important in CNOI contests, especially in those with output-only tasks. I have been doing these contests for years but still, don\u0027t know how to deal with these tasks properly. If you have some good suggestions for me, leave your comments down below.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLate at night I did the qualification round of Codejam, and had the same lackluster performance. I did poorly in the last task, where I changed my algorithm multiple times and even got a wrong try. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt seems I had pretty much enthusiasm in the first two days, while in the next couple of days there won\u0027t be many contests so I may just write a few words. Please stay tuned, though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 9th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA normal Sunday, nothing happened. I was busy whole day and didn\u0027t do any coding. Good news is that all my large outputs in the qualification round passed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 10th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSorry for the delay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI continued to solve problems of GCJ 2016 final.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn problem B I did something really awkward. First I came up with the correct conclusion, but then I debunked it by giving out a plausible counter-example. Then I had no idea and was like thinking desperately for a long time until \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-red\" href\u003d\"/profile/Reyna\" title\u003d\"Grandmaster Reyna\"\u003eReyna\u003c/a\u003e told me the conclusion was correct and my counter-example was somehow wrong. The issue of the example was quite hard to find. When I see no hope finding the solution, I should just re-think what I have disproved or re-read the statements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, I got a wrong try despite the small amount of coding, which as you know was quite common to me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I solved problem C quite easily, as I was spoiled by \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-legendary\" href\u003d\"/profile/Petr\" title\u003d\"Legendary grandmaster Petr\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"legendary-user-first-letter\"\u003eP\u003c/span\u003eetr\u003c/a\u003e in his blog once upon a time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 11th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTried to solve problem D.

Hoped I wouldn\u0027t need to read the solution this time. However, as I\u0027ve spent so much time on it, I don\u0027t think I would solve it in CTSC should it appear that time, which would be quite fatal for me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 13th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eI finally solved problem D. I\u0027ll show you my thinking route.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe statement can be found \u003ca href\u003d\"https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/dashboard?c\u003d7234486#s\u003dp3\u0026amp;a\u003d3\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst I was in an utterly wrong path. I tried thinking on shrinking the path, like changing zigzags into strange lines. When you have a \u0027C\u0027 shaped route, its length can be decreased by 2 moving it one step inside.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, it didn\u0027t turn out to be as simple as I thought, as moving it one step inside wasn\u0027t an easy job. If we just delete every block in the corresponding column or row, we may accidentally create a much shorter path.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrustrated, I had to try to find a brand new idea. I found that although shrinking C wasn\u0027t viable, decreasing length by 2 was, so I hypothesized that if the length isn\u0027t minimal, we can always decrease the length by exactly 2 someway.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote that the parity of the length can\u0027t be changed. Thus, my hypothesis is equivalent to that it\u0027s possible to decrease the length to anything not less than the direct distance disregarding all blocks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThus, I wrote a program that for every block, if deleting it doesn\u0027t decrease the distance to less than D, delete it. This can be done in \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eO\u003c/i\u003e((\u003ci\u003eRC\u003c/i\u003e)\u003csup class\u003d\"upper-index\"\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e for each case. I passed small this way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, I wasn\u0027t able to solve large for a long time until today it suddenly dawned on me that I should consider 4-connected components of blocks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI found that as long as deleting a block doesn\u0027t create a new component, the distance can be decreased at most by 2, and proving it needs all the conditions listed in the statements, which was a good harbinger of my route being correct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever not until tens of minutes later did I really have a solution---binary search. First, find a sequence of deleting blocks so that no new components are created at any moment of the process. Then binary search the time when the distance is exactly D, and \u003cem\u003evoila\u003c/em\u003e, we solve the task in \u003cimg align\u003d\"middle\" class\u003d\"tex-formula\" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/35/95/35956ab8ab6fb702da5976f7a7d8030d87d9a13d.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e time, which is acceptable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is quite exciting when I finally found out the solution, but it is still obvious that I would have little chance to solve it during the contest.

I implemented it slowly and steadily---first used brute-force, passed the samples, and then changed the slowest parts into a segment tree, stress tested it with brute-force.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, I tried to solve the second one. First I thought it must be the most difficult one based one my usual easy-first sequence of solving tasks. However, I eventually found it to be the easiest one and solved it with ease.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I did some checking and found both my brute-force and final solution on task one have one small but critical issues. I fixed it within seconds, but it was totally horrible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the final results turned out tragic. While both \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-red\" href\u003d\"/profile/jiaqiyang\" title\u003d\"International Grandmaster jiaqiyang\"\u003ejiaqiyang\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-orange\" href\u003d\"/profile/Philipsweng\" title\u003d\"Master Philipsweng\"\u003ePhilipsweng\u003c/a\u003e got the full score, I did not. My solution to task one fitted the time limit narrowly in my computer, which was faster than the judges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it was just one of these days. The second day turned out to be a total failure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter reading the first two tasks, one of which made no sense to me and the other of which a geometry task, I decided to go for task three.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTask three happened to be a math problem, which wasn\u0027t such an obstacle, but solving it took me quite a long time due to all the tiny mistakes I had made. It was 2 hours since the match started then.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTask one seemed to me a complicated task with two separate parts, the first of them quite simple and the other kind of hard. Nonetheless, after writing a small program and did some testing, I found out that a simple dfs can do the second part efficiently. The rest of the task was trivial, and I solved it before 11:30, with 1.5 hours left.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI soon found out a plausible solution to the second task and coded it out happily in the illusion that I should get a full score. I managed to pass all the samples before 12:30.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe rest is history---of course, I didn\u0027t get a full score. My solution to the first task was wrong and got only 40% of the score, and the more staggering fact was that my solution to the second task didn\u0027t get any score. After some thinking, I disproved my solution and was quite surprised at the absurdity of my solution and my gleeful reaction to an imaginary accomplishment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t need to be \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-legendary\" href\u003d\"/profile/tourist\" title\u003d\"Legendary grandmaster tourist\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"legendary-user-first-letter\"\u003et\u003c/span\u003eourist\u003c/a\u003e to guess that \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-red\" href\u003d\"/profile/jiaqiyang\" title\u003d\"International Grandmaster jiaqiyang\"\u003ejiaqiyang\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-orange\" href\u003d\"/profile/Philipsweng\" title\u003d\"Master Philipsweng\"\u003ePhilipsweng\u003c/a\u003e both got higher scores than me. What is more, I don\u0027t think I would enter the provincial team were I an eligible participant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat is my sad story these days. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eObviously, the biggest bane of my woe was my ostensibly correct algorithm to the second task in the second contest. It should be an axiom that no idea is better than bad ideas. Having no idea makes you frustrated, while you still have a decent control of the contest, because you know what you are doing and what you should do, either write subtasks or try other problems. However, having a bad idea means you are misled to an abyss of passiveness, as you no longer control the contest, and are fully unconscious of what you are actually doing, let alone what you should do, and, most severely, never change the way of doing until you notice the issue of your idea hours later or even after the contest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere will soon be another Codeforces round. Wish me good luck!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause I was really sleepy, I just did the first four simple tasks and didn\u0027t find the solution to the fifth task, which was actually not difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt seems the truth is not quite what I purported above.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third task in the first contest, purported TLE, was actually wrong. I, not the judges, am to blame. It seems my last effort to squeeze my solution gave rise to a boner, which somehow, I didn\u0027t find during the contest although I did some stress testing about it. I am now quite sure that it was because my generator was too weak. It was actually a fluke that the solution got 70/100, giving me the illusion that it was because of slowness instead of incorrectness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, I still haven\u0027t mentioned one of the tasks yet---the third task of the second contest, which was because the data was modified and when I updated the post last night, I didn\u0027t know the final results. However, it seems the data is not the only thing to blame. I made another blunder in my solution---I didn\u0027t take the remainder in one sneaky place, and it proved furtive. The modulus was quite small, and the range of the data I did stress testing on was small as well, so all these efforts have no avail to fixing this issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy mistake on the first task of the second contest is also a somewhat algorithmic one. One essential speed up in my dfs is wrong. However, simply swapping two lines can make my solution great again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second task to the second contest turned out to be the most difficult one. After some thinking, I found out a solution. However, I don\u0027t think I could have made it during the contest as it is quite tricky.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 18th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpent time on Codeforces #409 E. Despite all the rejected submissions, I actually managed to solved it with little debugging but instead finding every mistake with naked eyes(Can eyes with glasses be called \u0026quot;naked\u0026quot;?). I was exhilarated by the fact that by the time I couldn\u0027t manage to find any other mistake, my program had really got Accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell...Obviously, I should have made fewer mistakes, but at least it\u0027s been ages since I can find all mistakes with naked eyes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eApparently, I am more sanguine than before now. Everybody experiences boom and bust during his competitive programming career, but no bust lasts forever. I never feel contented with my coding skill, but I feel relatively fine with my thinking skill. I crave having a coding skill as strong as my thinking skill. I have thought about doing a full-scale revolution on my coding habits, but no sooner than my enthusiasm waned. However, several years ago I had the exact same feeling on my thinking skill. Unfortunately, if I had a time machine and traveled back to the past and met my past self, I would have no good way to enlighten him, because the natural accrual of thinking abilities has benefited me the most. I think it\u0027s the same with coding skill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 19th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorked on my research paper, which is about recursions of a given sequence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause it\u0027s part of assignments for the candidates so I have to use Chinese, which of course I\u0027m fluent in, but after spending so much time on English recently I actually sometimes came up with English and had to do the translation. For example, I would like to use \u0026quot;blah blah blah, which is blah blah\u0026quot;, which can\u0027t be translated into Chinese easily(Like this sentence). Actually, I think writing in English can be more precise than writing in Chinese because it\u0027s easy to make my sentence equivocal in this language(Prepare for this: \u0026quot;爱上一个人\u0026quot; has 4 interpretations, which are \u0026quot;Love someone\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Love to roast the broomstick with someone\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Love the previous person\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Love to be alone\u0026quot;).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 20th, 21th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eKept revising my research paper, and doing other parts of the assignments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 22th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eI continued to do the assignments and did google Codejam R1B. Although no wrong try in smalls, I was too slow. However, I don\u0027t mind it because I purposely spent more time to be more steady. Hope all three larges can pass with this steadiness. (update: they passed)\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 23th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eGot all my assignments done and submitted. Hope I can get a decent score on them. At least I can\u0027t bear if I can\u0027t stay No.1 before CTSC has even started.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the way, since some of you asked, my research paper was on Berlekamp-Massey algorithm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey will be a Codeforces round later. Wish everybody good luck.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 24th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy performance on this Codeforces round was a flop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy B, C and D got staggering 8 failed attempts in total. 2 hacks were to no avail.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo add insult to injury, I didn\u0027t pass the first sample of problem G during the contest. Instead, I passed it minutes after the contest after some tiny modifications. Actually, I\u0027d rather it has more mistakes than these. The biggest pity is that you don\u0027t get your solution right during the contest, but get it correct right after it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUpsolved E, F and G during the day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 25th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eUpsolved 798E. It needs an algorithm that I didn\u0027t know before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 26th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolved a task from CTSC2015. I was pretty sad that every mistake I made was still the most primitive ones, and the most irritating thing was that no matter how tiny changes of my code, many mistakes would come out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt should be simple for everybody to at least get the names of the variables you used in the code right, but this seems to be a tough thing for me. I think around half of the mistakes and also compile errors come from this issue. If this issue isn\u0027t fixed during CTSC, I\u0027ll pay hard for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 27th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eUpsolved a task from CTSC2016. It\u0027s the very task I failed last year. It seems pretty simple to me now. I don\u0027t know why I didn\u0027t manage to solve it back then.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 28th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday I tried to upsolve what is said to be the most challenging tasks from CTSC in history---CTSC 2011 infinite(无穷图的桥, bridges on an infinite graph). Although this task has been a nightmare for many people for many years, it is actually not so challenging to me. Still, I think it\u0027s one of the most interesting tasks from CTSC(I hope they will make more tasks like this one this year. This kind of tasks are much more intriguing than squeezing, complicated data structures, or boring output-only tasks).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBesides, what made me happy was that I made fewer mistakes today and passed all the test data upon passing the samples.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the way, the algorithm introduced \u003ca href\u003d\"http://e-maxx.ru/algo/bridge_searching_online\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e really helped me a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGood news is that with 134 contributions, I am one of the top contributors now. I sincerely thank you for your supports. Now I am finally a man that has been to both top rated list (for a long time, #4) and top contributors list.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 29th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday I got angry about RCC qualification round.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy problem D got TLE twice because of memset. I memset all the array, and there is a total of 100000 cases per data. What I did on the second attempt was to do some input optimizations, which really seemed necessary to me that time. I was surprised it wasn\u0027t the cause of TLE.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most irritating thing is on problem E, on which I write a randomized solution, but the use of random_shuffle would lead to WA. I was at my wit\u0027s end when I finally decided to probe whether it was due to some environmental differences, and surprisingly it paid off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, I spent around 20min on that issue, and I didn\u0027t manage to fix the last tiny issues of my solution. Had I had more time I would have at least more (much more I think) chances to get it passed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLesson learned, never use random_shuffle on RCC contests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUpdate: my solution seems too bad to get accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eApril 30th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003ePreparing the presentation of my research paper on CTSC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMay 1st, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDid a preparatory exam for CTSC at my school. I only managed to solve 1 out of 3 tasks. The rest 2 seemed really hard to me. One of them requires Minkowski difference, which I am not familiar with, and the other requires some mathematical insight, on which I struggled a lot even after reading the solution. It\u0027s like another SRM582 hard for me, which I did have a hard time on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMay 2nd, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDid a preparatory exam for CTSC at my school again. It was quite reminiscent of HNOI. The first task got RE because the array saving all the edges required 2 times the number of edges as the graph was undirected. My algorithm on the second task was bullshit again. I made some annoying tiny mistakes coding all my solutions as well. To add insult to injury, I spent a huge amount of time coming up with a solution to the third task, which was not extremely difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMay 3rd, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA one-day hiatus. Leaving Changsha to Beijing tomorrow. To train two days there. Then to begin the climatic battle---CTSC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI still need to perfect my presentation, and I hasn\u0027t begun writing my English speech for the final 6 to 4 phrase yet(Although if I am not lucky enough to get into top 6, this speech will be unnecessary, and if hopefully, I am top 4, were I not to be too hilarious on stage, I would be quite easy to enter the team).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolved 803E. The only bad thing was that I made several mistakes during the compiling phase, but once it passed the compilation it passed all data, no debugging needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI should keep the pressure on coding these days. I shouldn\u0027t try to solve something challenging now because it\u0027s a question whether I can make it before CTSC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMay 4th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eArrived in Beijing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere will be a Codeforces round soon. Everybody good luck and have fun. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMay 5h, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hacked four people during the Codeforces match, while didn\u0027t manage to solve E, so the result was just normal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI shouldn\u0027t have been so excited when I got rank 3 in the middle of the contest, which reduced my motivation to solve another task. Also, I shouldn\u0027t have spent so much time deciding whether to hack, to solve E or to read F, on which I ended up doing all, none succeeded.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHad an exam in the morning. Rehearsed the presentation in the afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMay 6th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eRehearsed English speech in the interview.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s kind of like another TOEFL speaking test for me. I still stammer a lot and make a lot of hilarious mistakes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMay 7th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first day in the CTSC event. We registered and tested the machine, during which I learned that there would be no output-only tasks, great news for me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTomorrow there will be the first contest of CTSC. If I don\u0027t want this post to be a farewell post to my OI career, I have to try my best. Wish me BEST luck!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMay 8th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first contest in CTSC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter reading all three tasks, I found every task pretty simple.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first task had a neat solution which was not too hard to find. I finished it and stress tested it before the one-hour mark.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith a smart insight, the second task was nearly identical to a task in IOI2016, which I knew the solution to. I finished everything before the two and a half hours mark.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third task seemed to me something that could be maintained by a segment tree. However I struggled a lot to get it correct. The worse thing was that my solution outputted \u0027nan\u0027 on generated data and I tried to get rid of it, only to have my solution too slow to fit into the time limit. Thus, my solution was wandering between outputting \u0027nan\u0027 and being too inefficient, which was the case until the very end moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnder the thought that everyone except me could get the third task correct, I was kind of sad after the contest. However, it happened that many people either didn\u0027t have the insight on the second task or forgot the solution to the IOI one, and many people had the same situation as me on the third task.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most dramatic thing happened after I read my results this afternoon---perfect score!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow can that be? My solution to the third task actually got accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter some communication, the reason turned out to be that my generator was actually in some aspect stronger than the setter\u0027s. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIronically, this was the same person who set the simple task I didn\u0027t solve last year. \u003cem\u003eC\u0027est la vie!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I have a very decent preponderance of score now, with 50 points more than rank2 today and 7 points under the scoring system of CTSC(100 in total).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTomorrow everybody will give his presentation, and the second contest will be on the day after.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMay 9th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003ePresentation day. Everything went well in the morning. However, when the scores came out this afternoon, they were really surprising. What we had expected to be good didn\u0027t necessarily get a decent score. Good thing is that the differences between our scores are tiny. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMay 10th, 2017\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second day of CTSC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first task seemed to be pretty simple, but the second one seemed intriguing, and the third a little unsolvable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThus, I decided to spend time on the second one. However, I was in the total state of mess, and after a long time of thinking still had no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI shifted my focus to the first task, hoping that after refreshing my mind by doing something else, I would be able to find something new on the second task.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I found the first task not as easy as I had thought, but I re-found a solution within minutes and implemented it pretty quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, I had no much idea on the second task. I kept on thinking about extreme cases. To add insult to injury, it seemed that even extreme cases didn\u0027t crack easily. The full solution seemed to be as far as Mars. I kind of wanted to just write some subtasks to ensure that I shouldn\u0027t fail too hard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter some calculation, as long as I could get around 200 points in this contest, I would still maintain my championship even if everyone else were to get 300. However, it seemed the gamut of subtasks I could solve waned badly. I had thought I could get 70 on task 2, but after testing my solution I found I could merely get 45.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat was worse, there was little time left. My 30-point solution on task 3 turned out to be not so correct as well. Knowing that the data was generated randomly, I decided to implement a heuristic solution with a magic number and finished it before the very end.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, after the contest ended, it first came to me that the data to the first subtask of task 3 were not generated randomly, while those of the other two were. Great, 30 points gone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, it turned out that I could have gotten a more decent score on task 2. I found some better solutions during the contest, but I was aiming for a full solution that time and didn\u0027t pay too much attention to them. When I gave up, it was too late and everything was done just in a hurry. Therefore, it\u0027s normal that I thoroughly forgot these better solutions after beginning to solve subtasks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA ridiculous thing was that the solution to the first task was even easier than I had thought. I thought the problem setter didn\u0027t find out the easier solution, but it turned out that it was the harder one that he didn\u0027t find, ergo the strange restriction that enabled the easier solution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter knowing that, as a case of \u003cem\u003edeja vu\u003c/em\u003e, my solution to the first subtask of task 3 managed to pass it again, and that I got all 175, it\u0027s obvious that I had no problem maintaining my national team membership. Actually, I got rank 1 with a decent margin---11 points higher than the second highest score by the 100-point system of CTSC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll is well that ends well. CTSC has ended, so let\u0027s meet the other three members.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-violet\" href\u003d\"/profile/xumingkuan\" title\u003d\"Candidate Master xumingkuan\"\u003exumingkuan\u003c/a\u003e, who, despite the failure in the first contest, managed to solved the third task in the second contest, which catapulted him from rank 12 to rank 2. This and its counterpart, falling from top to bottom, are actually common phenomena in CTSC. He also ranked 5th in NOI2016.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-red\" href\u003d\"/profile/jiaqiyang\" title\u003d\"International Grandmaster jiaqiyang\"\u003ejiaqiyang\u003c/a\u003e, another IGM in China. He got 195 in the first contest, and 155 on the second. Despite the normal performance on CTSC, his epic performance on WC2017 made him ranked 2nd before CTSC and eventually made him prevail.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-orange\" href\u003d\"/profile/eds467\" title\u003d\"International master eds467\"\u003eeds467\u003c/a\u003e, the only 11th-grade student who entered the team. He got 225 in the first contest, and 135 on the second. Despite the lackluster performance on the second day, his advantage accumulated when in the course of THU training and WC2017 combined with his fair performance on the first contest make him ranked 2nd during the hiatus of the two contests, and prevented him from failing. He currently had the 2nd highest rating on \u003ca href\u003d\"uoj.ac\"\u003eUOJ\u003c/a\u003e, where his \u003ca href\u003d\"http://wronganswer.blog.uoj.ac/blog/2611\"\u003epost including record of CTSC(in Chinese)\u003c/a\u003e can be found.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCongratulations to all of them!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTomorrow is the farewell day of CTSC, and I will leave Beijing and go back to my hometown.
