I was doing this problem from Gym contest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/gym/101047/problem/D\"\u003eLink to problem\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI came to know that there is no way to see test cases in Gym contest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI want to know What mistake I am making also I will appreciate any other solution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/ZKRaUL\"\u003eThis is my code\u003c/a\u003e which fails on second test. My approach is first run dijkstra from n\u0027th city and find shortest path theough boat for each city. Then for each city we can choose between Average+k or its original shortest path. So I try to minimize the average and find minimum value for first vertex.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
