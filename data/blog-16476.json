In my first contest, I solved 4 problems and ranked 13 in div 2, hence getting a new rating of 1766! However, in my second contest, #292 div 1, I made some silly mistakes, such as using \u0026quot;int\u0026quot; when \u0026quot;long long\u0026quot; is needed and misunderstanding the meaning of the problem. \u0026lt;o.O\u0026gt; As for the simpler problems, I didn\u0027t try the greedy algo because I was not sure. As a result, I didn\u0027t solve any problem and has gone back to div 2...  Anyway, it\u0027s the last day before the Chinese New Year and I hope I can make progress in the year of sheep, which means \u0026quot;luck\u0026quot; in Chinese!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["whatever"]}}
