I have come up with a solution which binary searches the minimum temperature and for each possible temperature I check the minimum distance by Dijkstra\u0027s Algo. It has passed the sample test case as well as all the test cases of uDebug, but it is giving WA in UVA. Can someone give me some test cases where my code may fail. \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/FeHANl\"\u003eMy solution\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPD\u003c/strong\u003e â€” I finally got it accepted.
