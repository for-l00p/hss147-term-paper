However, then I believe it would go 0-\u0026gt;3-\u0026gt;5-\u0026gt;SINK instead of 0-\u0026gt;1-\u0026gt;4-\u0026gt;2-\u0026gt;5-\u0026gt;SINK. Can anyone clarify :)?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIMAGE: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://imgur.com/z7Ywa6H\"\u003ehttp://imgur.com/z7Ywa6H\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["graphs"]}}
