Give N vertexes (N\u0026lt;\u003d200000), build a graph by completing M (M\u0026lt;\u003d200000) queries, each of them contain only one integer X (2\u0026lt;\u003d X \u0026lt;\u003d N), that means you must connect vertex 1 to vertex X, vertex 2 to vertex X+1, ..., and vertex N-X+1 to vertex N.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter built that graph, you have to list all connected components of that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for your help!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["graph"]}}
