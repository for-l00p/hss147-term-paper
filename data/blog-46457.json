GCD or Greatest Common Divisor of two or more integers, when at least one of them is not zero, is the largest positive integer that divides both the numbers completely without leaving a remainder.\n    For example GCD of 8 and 12 is \u00274\u0027. Wondering Y?? Lemme Xplain :P\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet us assume two integers \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027. Let \u0027x\u0027 be the largest integer that can divide both \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027 completely without leaving a remainder. Any guess about , What can be the range of \u0027x\u0027??\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1\u0026lt;\u003d\u0027x\u0027\u0026lt;\u003dminimum(a,b)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eY so?? Let us consider the example above shown:- gcd(12,8)\u003d4 . let me write the possible values of x for \u0027a\u0027\u003d12 and \u0027b\u0027\u003d8 x\u003d{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}; if we consider an integer greater than 8 then then the value of (b/x) is 0 because the denominator in such a case becomes greater than the numerator so the ratio is less than 1. Now, From all the values of set \u0027x\u0027 the numbers that divide \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027 completely are [1,2,4], but among these three values the largest number that divides both \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027 completely is \u00274\u0027. Hence gcd(12,8)\u003d4.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow how to compute gcd very fast... A serious issue :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore that lemme show some of the properties of divisibility that we will need in future. Theorem 1 : let \u0027a\u0027 be an integer and \u0027b\u0027 be a positive integer, then there are unique integers q and r, with 0\u0026lt;\u003dr\u0026lt;b such that a\u003d(b*q)+r : Rule of divisibility. That is if we divide \u0027a\u0027 by \u0027b\u0027 then \u0027q\u0027 denotes the quotient and \u0027r\u0027 denotes the remainder and we can write them as a\u003d(b*q)+r. for example a\u003d9 and b\u003d2. So when 9 is divided by 2 we get 4 as our quotient and 1 as the remainder. So 9\u003d(4*2)+1. And the remainder is always 0\u0026lt;\u003dr\u0026lt;b.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheorem 2. If \u0027a\u0027 is divisible by \u0027x\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027 is also divisible by \u0027x\u0027, then (a+b) is also divisible by \u0027x\u0027 as well as (a-b) is also divisible x. Reason :- If \u0027a\u0027 is divisible by x we can write it as  a\u003dq*x+0\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003efor some quotient q and remainder r\u003d0\n\n      Similarly , if \u0027b\u0027 is divisible by \u0027x then\n                     b\u003dk*x+0\n\n     for some quotient k and remainder r\u003d0\n\n     Now, a\u003dq*x            :-equation 1\n          b\u003dk*x            :-equation 2\n     So \u003d\u0026gt;a+b\n        from equation 1 and equation 2\n        \u003d\u0026gt;( q*x ) + ( k*x )\n        taking x common we get\n        \u003d\u0026gt;x*( q+k )\n     So we get,\n         \u003d\u0026gt; ( a+b ) \u003d x*( q+k )\n         \u003d\u0026gt; ( a+b ) \u003d x*( q+k ) + 0          :-equation 3\n         let u\u003d( a+b ) and  v \u003d ( q+k )\n         \u003d\u0026gt;    u    \u003d x*v + 0\n     So, u is divisible by x , as the equation states because the remainder part is zero.\n     Thus, as u\u003d(a+b) , so, (a+b) is divisible by x . \n     Hence Proved\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimilarly we can show that (a-b) is divisible by x. You can check this by yourself :) Just start with (a-b) instead of (a+b) and follow the steps above.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow back to GCD .. Hell yeah. Let \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027 be two integers and let \u0027g\u0027 be their greatest common divisor. So, gcd(a,b)\u003dg;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo \u0027g\u0027 is an integer that divides both \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027 completely without leaving any remainder,So we can write them as : \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0027a\u0027 is divisible by \u0027g\u0027. So, \u003d\u0026gt; a\u003dp*g+0 :equation 4 \u0027b\u0027 is divisible by \u0027g\u0027. So, \u003d\u0026gt; b\u003dq*g+0 :equation 5\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ehere p and q are the quotients when a and b are divided by g respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, By rule of divisbility if we divide a by b , we can write the equation as:  a\u003dt*b+rem here t is the quotient and rem is the remainder. Now,  \u003d\u0026gt;a-t*b\u003drem  Substituting the values of a and b from equation 4 and 5 we get:  \u003d\u0026gt;(p*g) — t*(q*g) \u003d rem  Taking g as common we get:  \u003d\u0026gt;g*( p — (t*q) ) \u003d rem  This equation can be rewritten as :  \u003d\u0026gt;[g*{ p — (t*q) }] + 0 \u003d rem  Sounds similar right. This means that \u0027rem\u0027 is divisible by \u0027g\u0027, as the remainder of the equation is zero. So, \u0027g\u0027 not only divides \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027 completely but also divides the remainder obtained when a is divided by b.\u003cbr /\u003e Thus we can say that:  gcd(a,b)\u003dgcd(b,remainder when a is divided by b)  we derived it right and this even reduces our computations now  So, gcd(a,b)\u003dgcd(b,r)  where r is the remainder when a is divided by b.  Now, terminating condition because we cant forever go on computing the remainder and never stop. We need to stop right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRemember i told u that the set of values \u0027x\u0027 for gcd(a,b) is actually 1\u0026lt;\u003dx\u0026lt;\u003dminimum(a,b). Assume a\u0026gt;\u003db. Now what if \u0027b\u0027 divides \u0027a\u0027 completely without leaving a remainder in such a case the largest integer dividing both \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027 is \u0027b\u0027 itself , So the set of x contains \u0027b\u0027 as a possible value for our gcd computation and also \u0027b\u0027 is the largest value in our range of set \u0027x\u0027 hence gcd is \u0027b\u0027 itself. Example gcd(12,4)\u003d4 itself. Baaammmmmm. Now we got our trick to end computing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLets start coding:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eC Code:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e#include\u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt;\nint gcd(int a,int b)\n{\n    if(a%b\u003d\u003d0)\n        return b;\n    else\n        return gcd(b,a%b);\n}\nint main()\n{\n    int a,b;\n    printf(\u0026quot;Enter the numbers\\n\u0026quot;);\n    scanf(\u0026quot;%d %d\u0026quot;,\u0026amp;a,\u0026amp;b);\n    int x\u003dgcd(a,b);\n    printf(\u0026quot;GCD of %d and %d is %d\\n\u0026quot; ,a,b,x);\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/vsi5wF\"\u003eideone link :-\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJava Code\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\nclass GCD\n{\n public static void main(String args[])throws IOException\n {\n  Scanner sc\u003dnew Scanner(System.in);\n  System.out.println(\u0026quot;Enter the numbers\u0026quot;);\n  int a\u003dsc.nextInt();\n  int b\u003dsc.nextInt();\n  System.out.println(\u0026quot;GCD of a and b is \u0026quot;+gcd(a,b));\n }\n static int gcd(int a,int b)\n {\n  if(a%b\u003d\u003d0)\n   return b;\n  else\n   return gcd(b,a%b);\n }\n\n}\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/jqZrZc\"\u003eideone link :-\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHappy Coding.
