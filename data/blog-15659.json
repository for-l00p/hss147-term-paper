It basically asks us to find total number of distinct slopes among n different points. Pretty easy( n \u0026lt;\u003d 200). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I did it using two approaches. First, I run two loops calculating all the slopes (the points are integers,and I took care and took input as doubles) and insert them in a set \u0026lt; double \u0026gt; taking care of case when dx \u003d0 (slope \u003d dy/dx). This approach got WA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn second, I do the same thing but I push the slopes in a vector and then sort the vector and take care of duplicates. This Got AC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://pastebin.com/kBYMQTS8\"\u003eYour text to link here...\u003c/a\u003e- Approach 1.-WA\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://pastebin.com/Z3rt9E6j\"\u003eYour text to link here...\u003c/a\u003e- Approach 2.- AC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan someone explain me the reason for this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank You.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["geometry","sort"]}}
