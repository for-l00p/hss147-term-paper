I found one specific data structure problem (\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/467/E\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e) to be very interesting. I found \u003ca href\u003d\"http://abitofcs.blogspot.com/2014/12/codeforces-round-267-div-2-problem-e.html\"\u003ea blog\u003c/a\u003e where much of this problem was explained (as there is no editorial..) but I was wondering if anyone could elaborate on how the blog writer used segment tree to solve this problem..
