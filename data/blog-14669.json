By clicking on Compare, you can see the only thing I did was removing one big array, f2, and its calculation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI thought that because my submission uses approximately 256MB, so I tried removing another big array, and surprisingly, it still got MLE: \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/382/submission/8645179\" title\u003d\"Посылка 8645179 от I_love_Hoang_Yen\"\u003e8645179\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I recalculated the memory that I used in the 3rd mentioned submission and see that I only used less than 100MB. Even deep DFS can not cause it to MLE. What is happening here? Can anyone explain?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["memory limit","strange behaviour"]}}
