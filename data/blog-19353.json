But the problem is more complicated because we handle two kinds of sets at once. Can anyone give a hint for this problem? (PS : I\u0027ve already try to write and proof my solution for 3 days but still get WA. I suspect I didn\u0027t cover all the possible cases in the problem. And sorry if I\u0027m not explaining my solution. It\u0027s too messed up I don\u0027t want to use it anymore.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["disjoint-set","data structures"]}}
