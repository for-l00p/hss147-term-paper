Some of you may wonder that why am I doing this when the editorials exist, there are 2 things about the blog that would be different from the editorials.\u003c/p\u003e \u003col\u003e   \u003cli\u003eI would be providing progressive Hints so that someone who is stuck on the problem may get a helpful jump start.\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eThe explanation I would be writing would be more comprehensive and easier to understand.\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://palashtanejapro.github.io/topics/codeforces-478c-table-decorations.html\"\u003eThis post\u003c/a\u003e is a good example of what I would be doing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would also like to introduce to you another project of mine called Human Benchmark, a platform where some fellow coders and non-coders would take different challenges like 28 hours days, Drinking certain beverages, etc and try to boost our productivity and mental capability to the fullest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf anyone would like to help for the Blog or for the Benchmarks please let me know in the comments or PM me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope you like my initiatives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHave a great day ahead!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
