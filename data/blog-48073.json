If you are not/were not part of Turkmenistan\u0027s Olimp team, probably this post, won\u0027t bother you.. For those who are/were, however, now it\u0027s just WERE. I mean now, \u0026quot;OLYMP CENTER\u0026quot; is closed. I\u0027m sorry for all of our students, as I were olso part of it. Last hope is that our \u0026quot;Olympic guys\u0026quot; will be still sticked together, but for now we are on our own...\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["tmcoteam","sadness","closing post"]}}
