I\u0027ve tried to look at code of red participants but didn\u0027t find any crucial difference in style of writing. There is one example of problem which I\u0027ve tried to solve many times, but it didn\u0027t pass all the tests (due to TLE) \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/719/submission/21066177\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/719/submission/21066177\u003c/a\u003e (the problem is \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/719/E\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/719/E\u003c/a\u003e) Could you help me with it? If yes, please, could you tell me what makes my code so slow?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance for any help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["time limit","unable to solve","slow"]}}
