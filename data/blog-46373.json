I am a student and preparing for my third ACM-ICPC season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecently, I found a site \u003ca href\u003d\"https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/\"\u003eICPC Live Archive\u003c/a\u003e, which contains many problems from different regionals competitions of past years. I solved some problems from here, but some of them are very easy for me, and some are very difficult. I think, that these problems more suitable for team trainigs, not individual (I haven\u0027t a stable team). Also, I solve a problems from school olympiads (USACO, National OI\u0027s and etc). In my opinion, these problems more suitable for individual trainings. Also, many of them \u0026quot;less standard\u0026quot;, then student problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI want to know, how many people solve school problems for preparing to ACM-ICPC? And which problems are more suitable for it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSorry for my bad English.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["acm","preparing"]}}
