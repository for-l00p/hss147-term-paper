I participated last year, and the format of the online phase was quite interesting. Besides the usual algorithmic problems, there were problems on cryptography, like MitM attack of Diffie-Hellman or AES bruteforce, and problems \u0026quot;without description\u0026quot;, when one should guess it from hidden hints. Problems had to be solved consecutively, so that a participant could not read the next one unless she solved the previous. But several passes were allowed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDetails:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003elink: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://contest.tuenti.net/\"\u003ehttps://contest.tuenti.net/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg\u003dTuenti5\u0026amp;iso\u003d20150427T1337\u0026amp;p1\u003d141\"\u003estart time in your TZ\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eduration: 7 days\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eprizes include cloth and gadgets :-)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["tuenti"]}}
