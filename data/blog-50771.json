Say, I am given an array of integers.pick a pair (i,j) such that \u0027i\u0027 is less than \u0027j\u0027. The task was to find out the number of times this pair will occur in all the contiguous subarrays of the given array.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003efor example\u003c/strong\u003e : number of elements — n \u003d 5; given array — 1 2 3 4 5 \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003esubarrays of given array — (1,2) (2,3) (3,4) (4,5) (1,2,3) (2,3,4) (3,4,5) (1,2,3,4) (2,3,4,5) (1,2,3,4,5)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003epair (1,2) occurs 4 number of times in subarrays (1,2) , (1,2,3) , (1,2,3,4) and (1,2,3,4,5); similirialy, pair (3,4) occurs 6 number of times in subarrays (3,4) , (2,3,4) , (3,4,5) , (1,2,3,4) , (2,3,4,5) , (1,2,3,4,5);\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow,\u003c/strong\u003e I found that for every pair (i,j) such that i\u0026lt;j, can find it ** (n-j+1)*i ** number of times.
