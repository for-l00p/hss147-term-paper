I need your advice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m good at math and this year I will go JBMO (Junior-Balkan-Math-Olympiad) (yes, my age is under 15), but not sure about BMO or IMO. I participated in APMO too. It was really hard for me, because I\u0027m preparing for Junior difficulty contests. I managed to score 8 points (P1 — 7, P3 — 1). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, there are many math problems in Codeforces, but if their difficuly \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e ≥ \u003c/span\u003e Div.2 C, I can\u0027t solve most of them. So, I need your help, how do you use math in programming? And sometimes I can find their math side solution but can\u0027t implement code. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know some guys which they have IMO and IOI (both) experience. One of them is \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-red\" href\u003d\"/profile/zscoder\" title\u003d\"Гроссмейстер zscoder\"\u003ezscoder\u003c/a\u003e. If you give some advice, I will be happy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also want to note that I\u0027m specialist in my real account (this is fake one).
