My \u003ca href\u003d\"http://pastebin.com/BVruRFSz\"\u003ecode\u003c/a\u003e uses line sweep technique. Initially I was getting a TLE, then I started to use \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/11080\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e set. Now I am getting WA veredict.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy idea is: I create 3 kinds of events:  — 0 — x of a start of horizontal line  — 1 — x of a vertical line  — 2 — x of a end of horizontal line then I sort the events, maintaining a set of active horizontal lines (their y\u0027s). When I get to a type 1 event (vertical line) I add to the answer the number of horizontal lines in the active set that are intersecting with the vertical line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan anybody tell if it\u0027s my idea or my implementation and give me some light please :D Thanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["geometry","line sweep"]}}
