I have found something weird. Some solutions are considering even the trees which are either (\u0026lt; l) or (\u0026gt; r). I have one testcase which proves this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003etestcase link : \u003ca href\u003d\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B088hEdwtfVCSG5KNTl1M3REdUk/view?usp\u003dsharing\"\u003ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B088hEdwtfVCSG5KNTl1M3REdUk/view?usp\u003dsharing\u003c/a\u003e  -\u0026gt; Query is (35916, 35926). you can check from the relation ship edges (by running a loop on them) that there are only three relationship edges which are useful for this query which are [(35922, 35924), (35923, 35925), (35925, 35926)]. using this answer will be 8, but answer from accepted solutions is 9. Even manually answer is 8.
