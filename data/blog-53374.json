I tried to make the final step of finding the minimum difference into the subset sum problem before realizing that there are restrictions on what numbers can go together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eE.g. I have components (Red, Blue) as (1, 5) and (2, 4); the optimal subset sum solution would normally be to put the 1 and 5 together, and the 2 and 4 together. However, the (1, 5) pair and (2, 4) pair are component pairs, which is not allowed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease help, and thanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["bicolorings"]}}
