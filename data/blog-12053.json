I\u0027ve participated on 2 contests recently; in the Functional Programming Contest I\u0027ve got \u003cstrong\u003efull score 8th place overall\u003c/strong\u003e and in the Weekly contests \u003cstrong\u003efull score again 4th place overall\u003c/strong\u003e, which I consider are quite good results, but my \u0026quot;rating\u0026quot; just increased a few points, and to my surprise I went down in the global Leaderboard, from 163 to 168, how is this possible? I tried to find some information in the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.hackerrank.com/scoring\"\u003eScoring\u003c/a\u003e page, but there is no clue about the \u0026quot;weight\u0026quot; of different kinds of contests, eg Functional, 101, 20/20, Weekly .... In Codeforces for a mere 107 place I got +88, which doesn\u0027t mean that is better or worse, on Codeforces I remember once that the rating system was changed when \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-legendary\" href\u003d\"/profile/tourist\" title\u003d\"Легендарный гроссмейстер tourist\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"legendary-user-first-letter\"\u003et\u003c/span\u003eourist\u003c/a\u003e got 1st and his rating decreased, indeed there was something wrong with the rating calculation (someone correct me if I\u0027m wrong), TopCoder implemented a quite sophisticated rating system... Could someone explain how the global rating works on HR?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUPDATE: It seems like the global Leaderboard becomes crazy, users are placed multiple times with different ratings. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["hackerrank","rating"]}}
