There will be a 1 hour time change for many countries. So pay extra attention to the contest timings in your local timezone. Happy coding!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePS : For Indian participants, the regular CF rounds will start from 10 pm instead of 9 pm. Yay!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEdit : Here I am telling everyone to be careful about contest timings while comfortably forgetting myself. I saw the time for today\u0027s SRM (638) a week before and never bothered to check again. Result, I woke up at 6:15 am thinking that the SRM would start at 6:30 am while actually it was to start at 7:30 am. Damn you daylight saving!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["contest time"]}}
