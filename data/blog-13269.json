You can follow the links to various pages on the document by clicking on them (just like if you were reading the comments on \u003cstrong\u003eCF\u003c/strong\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope a few other users also noticed these comments. I\u0027m sure all of you were very frustrated that there were so many of them. Surely we need to do something to make \u003cstrong\u003eCF\u003c/strong\u003e better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, there have been many more spam posts/comments from these three users (\u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-green\" href\u003d\"/profile/delairer\" title\u003d\"Pupil delairer\"\u003edelairer\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-blue\" href\u003d\"/profile/contest1234\" title\u003d\"Expert contest1234\"\u003econtest1234\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-green\" href\u003d\"/profile/majid1234\" title\u003d\"Pupil majid1234\"\u003emajid1234\u003c/a\u003e) in the past few weeks. I think they should be banned from \u003cstrong\u003eCF\u003c/strong\u003e, or atleast prevented from writing any more posts/comments in future (if this is possible).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["spam","comments"]}}
