The DMPG \u002718 is a set of 3 contests divided into three divisions, Gold (hard), Silver (medium), and Bronze (easy). Each contest is a 3-hour virtual contest with a problemset of 6 problems which are disjoint from the other divisions, so you can choose to participate in any subset of the contests (or, if one division is too hard, you can switch to an easier division). These contests will not impact any rating on any platform, so feel free to just enter and look at the problems without any obligation to write code for them. The contests will be hosted on the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://dmoj.ca\"\u003eDMOJ platform\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://dmoj.ca/contest/dmpg18d1open\"\u003eGold Contest\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href\u003d\"https://dmoj.ca/contest/dmpg18d2open\"\u003eSilver Contest\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href\u003d\"https://dmoj.ca/contest/dmpg18d3open\"\u003eBronze Contest\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"https://camo.algome.me/4093dcc286b5c82beba4c03760e4e292b568ddbd/68747470733a2f2f646d6f6a2e6d6c2f646174612f646d706731382f646d70672e706e67\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe contest window is 24 hours beginning tomorrow (April 24) at 11:00 a.m. EDT and ending at the same time the day after; you may pick any 3 hour interval at your convenience during this contest window to solve the problems in. Your interval will end after 3 hours or when the contest window ends at 11:00 a.m. EDT on April 25.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe scoring format will be in the form of subtasks; you get partial marks for each subtask you solve correctly. Additionally, each of the 6 problems have a maximum of 100 points, so a perfect score will be 600 points. During the contest you will have full feedback. Ties in the scoreboard will be broken by the sum of highest-scoring submission times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the bronze and silver division, the problems are approximately arranged in order of increasing difficulty. The gold division is ordered to mimic the standard order of a two day contest (problems 1 and 4 are easiest, followed by problems 2 and 5, and finally problems 3 and 6 are the most difficult).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe difficulty of the Gold contest will be similar to a CF Div 1 round, except that the hardest problem will be easier. A similar situation applies for the Silver contest and a CF Div 2 round. The Bronze contest does not have an equivalent on Codeforces, but it is around that of a USACO Bronze division.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#contest","announcement","dmoj"]}}
