I wonder something, why dont we have more contests ? I have heard that there is a waiting list for contests but it shows there are enough contests. For example right now the next contest is in 10 days and I think it is really really far away.it would be very great if there was one contest every three days. I dont know how possible this is but can someone tell me why this is not how it is ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
