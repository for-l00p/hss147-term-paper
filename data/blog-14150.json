But if he did not solve A and B simultaneously, he solved problem A in less than 2 minutes! This problem A isn\u0027t that simple(it took fastest participant 5 minutes). Also, he made his first submission to problem D, just 1 minute after his submission to C.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso his codes are a bit strange.

Usually, a person use the same template to avoid confusion. However, the three submissions seem to be based on different template. First code defines pair\u0026lt;int, int\u0026gt; as PII; but the second and third define pair\u0026lt;int, int\u0026gt; as pii; It would be too confusing!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe matters are almost the same in his last round — Bayan 2015 Contest Warm Up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf he participated individually, I want to know why he made such a strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["cheating"]}}
