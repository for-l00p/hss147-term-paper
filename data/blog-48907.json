Were the stuff answering?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is my short, sad story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI written email with propositions of the tasks about one YEAR ago. After few days I\u0027ve got a response from \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-red\" href\u003d\"/profile/GlebsHP\" title\u003d\"Гроссмейстер GlebsHP\"\u003eGlebsHP\u003c/a\u003e \u0026quot;Okay, your proposition is received and will be evaluated in a few next weeks. \u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe delay turned out to be huge. My question is : Should we take it for granted that this is how it looks like?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/03/6f/036f3cc828d292ab0f419ef28ae283a4241cca7e.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore seriously, this is something which should be dealt with. Of course, we are all trying to make the community as satisfied as possible. But anyway it is really uncomfortable and also discouraging. Problems may get outdated or improved, the proposal should be probably rewritten after such a long period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat could the Codeforces stuff do about it? Do you have any ideas?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
