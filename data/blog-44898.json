Near the Le Meridien hotel (and also probably all around the Phuket) you can meet unfriendly homeless dogs. If you don\u0027t want them to attack you, try avoiding them and hold big stone in your hand (to make them afraid of you, not to throw at them :f). One of them bite me yesterday in the leg from behind (2 mins walk from hotel) even though I didn\u0027t tease him or anything and I needed to go to hospital to take rabeis and tetanus vaccinations. So don\u0027t worry about me, but be careful about yourself, I don\u0027t want any of you to experience similar troubles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["phuket","dogs","icpc"]}}
