Probably the constant background ranking updating caused the data loss. As a mobile data user it was a matter of concern for me and I used to keep data connection off during solving the problem and switch it on while submit solution to reduce the data loss.\u003cbr /\u003e However, in today\u0027s contest I noticed that there was no background data loss at all during contest time! Everything was normal and I felt free to keep my data connection all time. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s caused by enhancement of Codeforces\u0027s server or something but I am happy about it. :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
