For example if I meet a div 2 C,or D problem that I cant solve,then I look the editorial,and I add this problem to a list for remembering. After one week I try to solve it. But I can solve it easy,because I remember some steps.....\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy question is: Is good to re-solve old problems? If yes,then you need to have forgot the solution,or one week after is good?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks,and sorry for bad english :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
