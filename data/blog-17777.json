If a player has at least A points, and is at least B points ahead of his opponent, that player wins the game.Now given p which is the likelihood of player1 beats player2, we want to know the possibility that player1 winning the game. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eoriginal description is \u003ca href\u003d\"http://community.topcoder.com/stat?c\u003dproblem_statement\u0026amp;pm\u003d1849\u0026amp;rd\u003d4675\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI already know how to find a approximate solution by using : P(x, y) \u003d P(x-1, y) * p + P(x, y-1) * (1-p)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut how to solve this using equations?
