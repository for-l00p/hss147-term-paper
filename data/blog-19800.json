(N,M,K \u0026lt;\u003d 100000) for i-th query, I have 2 number (u[i],v[i]), it mean, if arcs(u[i],v[i]) don\u0027t exist, I will add them. if arcs(u[i],v[i]) exist, I will delete them. In M arcs, I have N-1 arcs can\u0027t be delete, it\u0027s spanning tree. So for each i-th query, I must find the number of bridges on this graph. Pls give me some idea for this problems. thank!!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP/s : sorry for my bad english \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
