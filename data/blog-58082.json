I\u0027m doing a dfs and calculating the nodes that can be reached from the starting node s. If the graph does\u0027nt have any sink-nodes (nodes from which you can\u0027t move out or nodes with no out-edge), the game will be a draw. Now, if there are any sink-nodes that have odd path length from the starting node Petya can win. For now I haven\u0027t considered the problem of a cycle when there are multiple paths between two nodes and Petya can chose which path to follow for winning. I believe I\u0027m using memory of the O(7*n) as n ~ 2*m for the question, n is no of vertices and m is no of edges. I believe this should not exceed the memory limit of 256 MB.
