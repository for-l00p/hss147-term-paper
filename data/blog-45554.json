I used to work pretty hard to achieve my level, and now I try to take part in every CF round I can, but I\u0027m not working on tasks outside of that. If I know a problem has a listed solution somewhere I give up after a while, or even when I get the solution right I don\u0027t code it. Similarly I know the ideas behind algorithms and structures I have never written, so even if I notice the pattern I\u0027m stuck. How do you \u0026quot;fight\u0026quot; with issues like that? :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
