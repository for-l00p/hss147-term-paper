I in search of complete implementation of topics like Segment Tree , Binary Index Tree , Lowest Common Ancestor in Binary Tree , Sparse Tree , Tries , Graph Basic implementaion for fast start in contests , Square Root Decomposition , Dinic\u0027s Algorithm and other MAX-FLOW algorithms , Pattern Matching algorithms like Aho-Corasick , Z Function ,Rabin Karp , Boyer Moorre . Implementation of Suffix Array , Suffix Tree ,Ukkonen\u0027s Algorithm .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd all other that you all use for better , fast and efficient participation .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope newbies throughout the world can become good coders if they are motivated by coders better than them. And then we can also compete and take the competition to the next level of toughness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSorry if I wasted anyones time by posting this. But I am unable to find good implementations anywhere on the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
