It explains an amazing algorithm developed by Aho, Hopcroft and Ullman which finds out if two rooted trees are isomorphic in linear time. I have searched for this problem on several online judges in order to test my implementation, but have had no success. If anyone has seen a problem that requires this algorithm could he/she be so kind to share the link?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny help is appreciated :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#trees","isomorphism"]}}
