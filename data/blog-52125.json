Along with that Codeforces Round #416 (Div. 2) is also scheduled on the same day at 20:05. It would be better if we can re-schedule Round #416 a day before or later. So, can we shift the dates? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUpdate: The issue is clear. There was discrepancy regarding whether Snackdown Pre-elimination rankings will be ACM style or score based. As they mention ACM style in contest page and score based in Rules section. Upon hovering over to rules page it is now clear that the ranklist will be score based.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["snackdown2017","round #416","clash"]}}
