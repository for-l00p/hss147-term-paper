However, i\u0027m extremely bad at this. I solve problems, but hardly revisit them due to reasons like laziness and greediness to solve more problems rather than resolving the solved ones again. Due, to this i am unable to solve the solved problems when i visit them after a long time. I would love to hear the various revision techniques you guys use during training. Do you only check your previous solution, or you code it again from scratch. Please, share your techniques so that we all can be benefited from each others experiences. Suggestions from people who have trained for IOI or ICPC will be greatly appreciated :) \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
