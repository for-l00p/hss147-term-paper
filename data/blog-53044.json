I figured out the recurrence for the problem which is f(x, y) \u003d f(x — 1, y) + f(x, y — 1) + f(x — 1, y — 1), f(x, 0) \u003d f(0, y) \u003d 1. The constraints of the problem does not allow me to use normal DP and I\u0027m not aware how to use matrix exponentiation technique for 2-D recurrence. I read this article: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://threads-iiith.quora.com/Solving-Dynamic-Programming-with-Matrix-Exponentiation\"\u003ehttps://threads-iiith.quora.com/Solving-Dynamic-Programming-with-Matrix-Exponentiation\u003c/a\u003e but I could not fully understand the idea. Any help is really appreciated. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["2d-dp","#matrix exponentialtion"]}}
