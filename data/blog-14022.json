Then those floors can be arranged as having 3,2,1 rooms, which meet the requirement. But we could wrongly arrange the house as having 2,2,2 rooms as well. In both cases (N+F)%3\u003d\u003d0.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this example it doesn\u0027t matter. But how do we know in some case we would not be counting a wrong configuration of floors? Of course I cannot come up with a counterexample, I\u0027m sure the tutorial is correct, but I just don\u0027t understand how \u0026quot;divisible by 3\u0026quot; also implies \u0026quot;decreasing rooms on each floor\u0026quot;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["question"]}}
