The idea is that I find the maximum interference level between each pair of intersection points, and do a Range-Maximum-Query on the segments the query overlaps. It seems that I have the correct idea/complexity since my code passes the cases of Batch 2 (consisting of max case), but I WA on the Batch 1 Cases. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think the error I have lies in how I determine the indices for querying in lines 98-120, but I have not been able to find/fix it. Where did I go wrong in solving the problem?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease help, and thanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEDIT: Bump? I would appreciate if someone commented what additional information they would need to help me out instead of relentlessly pushing the downvote button...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEDIT 2: Ended up solving it (YAY!) by changing the custom comparator for \u0026quot;Intersection\u0026quot;, but I don\u0027t know why it works.
