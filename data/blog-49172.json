Its a simple dfs with an extra iterating variable, but I\u0027m confused as to why it\u0027s returning wrong answer. I\u0027m 90% sure that the string processing part of my code is correct, so that leaves the dfs() function that probably has a bug in it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003evector\u0026lt; string \u0026gt; height[] is the array that I use to store the strings that are on a certain level, and I use vector\u0026lt; int \u0026gt; comma to store the position of the commas to make it easier to extract the numbers and the strings. Also, mx is the maximum height of a comment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for your time everyone!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
