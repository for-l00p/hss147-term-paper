As you can see, when you are viewing a submission details, a new button \u0026quot;Compare\u0026quot; appears:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.myspacegens.com/\"\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\"Image Hosted At MyspaceGens\" border\u003d\"0\" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/a5/8c/a58c67189e9a0d13a9b5796ad00e4c4813e066b3.jpg\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e If you click the button, you can choose another submission, and Codeforces will show you the difference between the current submissions and the one you chose:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.myspacegens.com/\"\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\"Image Hosted At MyspaceGens\" border\u003d\"0\" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/bf/66/bf668e8b089033fd474ad27180dffb625cc0c85d.jpg\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think this function is useful. For example, you solved a problem long time ago, and now you forgot the solution! You look at your accepted code to see how to solve it. You have made two submissions, one correct, one incorrect. With \u0026quot;Compare\u0026quot; funcion, you can easily find the mistakes in your incorrect submission. Therefore, you can determine the reason of your mistakes (a small bug in coding, or a tricky test case).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope my discovery will have you a lot! Thank you for reading it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["compare","function","codeforces"]}}
