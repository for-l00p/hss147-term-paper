The latter problem can be solved using the combination of a preorder traversal and BIT.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was wondering if it is possible to solve the former problem with a combination of a Segment Tree and DFS (closest possible method to a preorder traversal). The segment tree would use lazy propagation to update the range of edges, but I am not sure how to use a DFS in this situation. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAm I on a right track? If so, I would appreciate input on how to continue. If not, please point me to another possible solution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease help, and thanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["bit/fenwick tree","usaco","hld"]}}
