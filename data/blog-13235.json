Most notably, they don\u0027t seem to describe the intersecting chain property, which I think is a useful way of seeing why Fenwick trees work. Comments and/or critiques for this tutorial are appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLink here: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://math-porn.tumblr.com/post/93129714459/range-queries-and-fenwick-trees\"\u003ehttp://math-porn.tumblr.com/post/93129714459/range-queries-and-fenwick-trees\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["fenwick tree","binary indexed tree","range query"]}}
