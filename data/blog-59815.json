One wants to invite the maximum number of people given to m constraints that a group X and a group Y cannot be invited together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eExample:- Group No. 1 2 3 4 5 6  Size of group 3 4 7 2 8 10\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuppose m\u003d3 and X\u003d1, Y\u003d6.  X\u003d2, Y\u003d4.  X\u003d1, Y\u003d5. I don\u0027t know the answer but it can be calculated for small cases like these but I thought a lot about formulating it as a dynamic programming problem but couldn\u0027t reach anywhere. Any help is appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#dynamic-programming","problem solving"]}}
