The editorial however did not give proof for the DP state and transition , and I am having a lot of trouble actually understanding how the DP transition is working...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProblem : \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/543/problem/C\" title\u003d\"Codeforces Round 302 (Div. 1)\"\u003e543C - Remembering Strings\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolution : \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/543/submission/11035719\" title\u003d\"Submission 11035719 by gridnevvvit\"\u003e11035719\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Thoughts\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ethe DP state is \u0026quot;mask\u0026quot; which denotes the strings that have been already made easy to remember..
