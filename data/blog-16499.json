A person will board the ship allotted to him only if all the people already in that ship have lesser height than him (else he feels inferior). \u003cbr /\u003e As the manager, you need to find a way to maximize the number of people that can board these m ships. \u003cbr /\u003e (Sorry I dont remember the exact constraints on m,n but they are pretty big) \u003cbr /\u003e Input : \u003cbr /\u003e n m \u003cbr /\u003e a1 a2 a3 ... an \u003cbr /\u003e Output : \u003cbr /\u003e k \u003cbr /\u003e (a single integer 0\u0026lt;k\u0026lt;\u003dn which is the maximum people that can be allotted to these m ships) \u003cbr /\u003e Example : \u003cbr /\u003e 5 2 \u003cbr /\u003e 4 2 5 1 3 \u003cbr /\u003e Output : \u003cbr /\u003e 4\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["flow"]}}
