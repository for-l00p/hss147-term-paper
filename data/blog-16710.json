I\u0027m talking about problems C, D and E (or A, B and C of Div 1), if you compare any recent Div 1\u0027s A, B, C to any recent Div 2 only\u0027s C, D, E, I think the former would be more interesting to solve. Do you guys feel the same too?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["problem quality","div 2 only contests"]}}
