In each query we are given a point with its coordinates and we have to output the point in the set which has maximal distance to the queried point. What is the most efficient algorithm for solving the task(which is not too long/complex to be used in competitions)? Also, what if we could add/remove points from the set? I couldn\u0027t think of anything else that bruteforcing every possible point in our set, but I\u0027m looking for something faster(maybe O(logN) per query?).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["geometry algorithm","distance"]}}
