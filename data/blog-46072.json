I used two vectors to store occurrences of both prefix and suffix; the problem was how to indicate that two sub-strings are different I looked for other submissions i notice that they used a map and a long long number to have this. my question is: wouldn\u0027t we have an overflow? how can we be sure that two different sub strings wouldn\u0027t have the same number as a result of overflow?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#dp","#strings","#data structure"]}}
