Since then I am a regular here and I have done 13 contests till now but now I get a feeling that my rating has got stuck in this range of 1550-1630. I have basic knowledge of algorithms like dynamic programming (to some extent) and graph algorithms. But only sometimes I am able to solve Div2 C and almost never Div2 D and Div2 E. Any advice on how should I practice to improve form here? I tried to solve dp problems in problemset in descending order of number of submissions. Now I have done page 1. Should I continue to page 2 or should I solve other types of problems now like bitmasking, max flows? And also, will this kind of practice actually help me at all?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for any help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
