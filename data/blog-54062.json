Today I am going to describe some contents (programming) Which can be helpful for contestants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt first I assume that you all know about C/C++ language . But It doesn\u0027t matter . I think you also know about conditional logic , loop , datatype(input/output) , strings, array, function , basic bitwise operation etc . I think then you should learn lots of Mathematical terms such as :\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrime number , GCD , LCM , Eular\u0027s Totirnt Function , Bigmod , Modular inverse , Extended GCD , combinatorics, permutation , combination , inclusion exclusion principle ,probability , Expected value , Base conversation , Big integer , cycle , Gawssian elimination etc etc........\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThen.....\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eyou have to learn about sorting and searching . like : Insertion sort , bubble sort , merge sort , selection sort , merge sort , county sort etc . NOTE : THERE IS A THING NAMED \u0026quot;qsort\u0026quot; function is C language.....don\u0027t use it . There is an algorithm named \u0026quot;anti-qsort\u0026quot; . If you use it in codeforces , anyone can easily hack your solution because anti-qsort algorithm generates worst case for qsort and in the worst case , it\u0027s time complexity will be O(n^2) . But you can use Standerd Template Library . \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThen........\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou have to learn Binary search , Backtraking , ternary search etc...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThen.......\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eyou have a task to learn lots of data structures . Such as : Linked list , Stack,Queue,heap , vector,graph,tree,segment tree , binary search tree , sqare root segmentation , disjoint set union , Lazy with proposition , lazy without proposition , Binary indexed tree , map , set , pair etc etc....\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThen........\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou haVe to learn greedy technique , Dyanamic programming , Graph algorithm , Flow , Adhoc , Geometry etc etc , I have summarized the contents bellow : 1. Dynamic Programming 2. Greedy 3 .Complete Search 4 . Flood Fill 5 . Shortest Path 6 . Recursive Search Techniques 7 . Minimum Spanning Tree 8 . Knapsack 9 . Computational Geometry 10 .Network Flow 11 . Eulerian Path 12 . Two-Dimensional Convex Hull 13 . BigNums 14 . Heuristic Search 15 . Approximate Search 16 . Ad Hoc Problems\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you clearup all those above , you will find a great programmer inside you , but mind it , It is not an easy tusk....You have to practice a lot . If you don\u0027t practice , you will never be able to be a good programmer .....!!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSO , NO MORE TODAY ,,,, STAY WELL EVERYBODY,,,,ALWAYS TRY TO HELP OTHERS...HAPPY CODING ! \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#advice","#for_beginners"]}}
