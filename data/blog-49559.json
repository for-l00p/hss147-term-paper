I know most great programmers go through this stage at least once in their lives. Their are times i am successful solving a solution without the help of google i HATE when i have to refer to google to find tips and ways to solve a particular problem. I get more by solving it myself without any references. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHonestly i didn\u0027t start coding till i was a sophomore in college in 2013 when i was 26 in my software engineering program. I am a little late in the game. I should have started when i was very young like all the great programmers where i can absorb more information faster and digest it but i can\u0027t turn back time just have to go with it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust one of my problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
