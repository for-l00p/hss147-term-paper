Due to this I wrote \u003ca href\u003d\"https://drive.google.com/open?id\u003d1B9BIfATnI_qL6rYiE5hY9bh20SMVmHZ7\"\u003electure notes\u003c/a\u003e which anybody can use as reference for Fast Fourier Transform. I added there almost anything one should need while using FFT in contests. Even if you suppose you know the algorithm I dare you to look this paper through since there still can be some new ideas for you. Also you can see Russian version \u003ca href\u003d\"https://drive.google.com/open?id\u003d1IdjyWinAT3Qo9oSonFj21VASBCJsxltB\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["fft","lecture","tutorial"]}}
