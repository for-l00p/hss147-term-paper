Is it grabbing pen and paper and trying brute force like \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eapproach to find solution? That would take a hell lot of time (at least for me). But this was an specific case, [k \u003d \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003en — 1] and using this case, general solution is obtained. So, is looking for some special cases a problem solving \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003estrategy?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI cannot infer how people reach such a simple and sweet solution for such a seemingly complex problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny suggestions would be helpful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["problem solving"]}}
