I was impressed by \u003ca href\u003d\"http://e-maxx.ru/algo/suffix_automata\"\u003eMaximal article\u003c/a\u003e for it and it helped me clearly grasp its concepts and applications. However, it is in Russian. I used yandex/google translate to understand it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are some articles for suffix automaton in English. Check \u003ca href\u003d\"https://saisumit.wordpress.com/2016/01/26/suffix-automaton/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/20861\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/22420\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring an algorithms course, I was required to write a report for a non-basic data structure. I picked suffix automaton, so that It can be useful for anyone. It is compiled with LaTeX and there is a presentation that contains a visualization for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5oUbKPT4g_ESk5raHlWZHd5WFk\"\u003elink\u003c/a\u003e. The article is not complete, but it contains the main points in Maximal article. It is just a translation for the original article (maybe I edited some parts, but not that much). If you need the source code, I can share it as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
