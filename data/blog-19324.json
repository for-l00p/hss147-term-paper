I came across this problem a couple of weeks ago: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://coj.uci.cu/24h/problem.xhtml?pid\u003d3228\"\u003ehttp://coj.uci.cu/24h/problem.xhtml?pid\u003d3228\u003c/a\u003e. The problem statement is pretty simple and straight to the point. I think I came up with a O( sqrt(N) * log(N) ) solution which might work: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/ibCkwY\"\u003ehttp://ideone.com/ibCkwY\u003c/a\u003e. But, I keep getting a TLE veredict. Is there a faster approach with Segment Tree or any other data structure? or even a better way to solve this one with Sqrt Descomposition?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank for reading, Any kind of help is appreciated\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["data structures","sqrt_decomposition","segment tree"]}}
