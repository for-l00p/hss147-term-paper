I don\u0027t have a link to the problem as it was asked in a private contest and I cant find it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProblem statement goes like this,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet A be a array of n elements ,  find the median of the array that is formed by differences of elements in A , our differences Array will have (n*(n-1)/2) elements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConstraints : n — [1,200000] A[i] — [1,10^9]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy approach (Incomplete) : \u003c/p\u003e \u003col\u003e   \u003cli\u003esort A.\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eLet D be the array that is formed by finding differences between consecutive elements i.e A[i+1] — A[i] (after sorting).\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eNow all the possible differences are sum of elements in some subset of D , of which we have to find the\u003cbr /\u003e((n*(n-1))/4)th largest difference.\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it ... I am stuck with the previous step ...\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eHelp me to proceed after this , Or if my direction of approach is not correct , Or some other solution for the problem. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["median","differences"]}}
