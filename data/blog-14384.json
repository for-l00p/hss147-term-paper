However reading carefully the rules described, I saw the following thing :\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommunication is realized with text commands sent through the TCP/IP protocol, described in details in the problem statement.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also checked problems from last year and indeed, they give you a set of commands you can send through TCP/IP to communicate with the contest system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow the problem is that none of our team has any clue how this whole TCP/IP communication works. I would really appreciate it if someone could explain how it works and how to create a C++ code that communicates through TCP/IP, as I believe that\u0027s what you are expected to do during the competition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you in advance! :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEdit: Turns out we can\u0027t participate due to complications with travelling, however the question is still valid! :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
