As my friend suggested, in order to practice implementing algo and DS, search problems with implementation tag, and solve from the most number of AC. I just solved problem 158A for my first AC in CF. I will try to solve one problem daily for beginner. See you in next update!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
