Competing and tackling algorithms and optimising and learning with others (great coders) boosts me and i never want to leave it just because most of the programmers opt further for development and sometimes leaving competitive behind ...as many big giant companies too want good developers ...so i want codeforces community to share their perspective ..whether one should also do development just for the sake of job or just competitive would do??\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dilemma","competitive","app development"]}}
