I would like very much to hear opinions about the best keyboard for coding. It would be nice to hear about specific keyboards that people have used already, about features that a good coding keyboard should have, and so on. I have been reading a while about such stuff, and everywhere the mechanical keyboards with those Cherry MX switches are heavily praised. I would like to hear a bit more from the programming community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["keyboard","typing","preferences"]}}
