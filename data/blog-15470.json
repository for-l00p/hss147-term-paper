This one is pretty big. I went through all submissions from every contest from this year and created the list of the most hacked problems in this year. Moreover, this list has some other informations like what was the problem with the biggest or the lowest number of accepts to it, what problems had strong and weak pretests and many more... \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCheck the full list \u003ca href\u003d\"http://test.weaselcrow.com/pro/cf/phack2014/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBe careful with some data, because you may not remember \u003ca href\u003d\"/blog/entry/10683\"\u003ethe Black Day of Codeforces\u003c/a\u003e, when some data was lost and in fact, it appears that there were no participants (and submits) for some round (it apply to most of the contests in February). Also, you may surprised that some hacks are count several times — it is because some people resubmitted their hacked solutions (without success) and I wondered where put such submission. I decided to keep it there (frankly, there were not so many such submissions so it doesn\u0027t change a lot).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe previous parts:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/blog/entry/15326\"\u003ebest hackers by sum of points\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/blog/entry/15369\"\u003emost accurate hackers\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["hackme","hacking","statistics","2014"]}}
