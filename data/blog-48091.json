Anything is appreciated :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStatement: There\u0027s a museum made up by \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eN\u003c/i\u003e * \u003ci\u003eN\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e cells, forming a square. We should place \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eN\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e guards, so that in every column and row there\u0027s exactly \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e guard. Also the guards have their \u0026quot;preferences\u0026quot;, so every of them have a rectangular area where he wants to be placed to guard. The problem is to give a distribution of the guards (\u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eN\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e points) where everyone is in his preferred rectangle or state that there\u0027s no such distribution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere\u0027s the statement in hungarian language with a picture too: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4izTGKCoUQyRmdBQXRJWUo4VVk/view?usp\u003dsharing\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you for reading, have a nice day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["greedy","museum"]}}
