I\u0027m looking forward to doing some research on well-known Traveling Salesman Problem. However, I never went into implementing this algorithm with some optimizations included as I don\u0027t know much about them. I tried googling, hoping to find some good resource of information about research on this particular problem, and was surprised not being able to find a good one. Does anyone know any good free e-book or anything similar which would guide me into details of this problem, as well as some optimizations and implementations, so I can try some of them and try to think about something clever myself, considering this problem? Thanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["tsp"]}}
