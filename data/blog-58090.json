(The maximum answer for N \u003d 2 is 4). Which is odd, because I have generated all tests in that range, and on my computer, they run well (or at least none of the answers is above 4). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoes anybody has an ideea of what could be the problem here?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSource code: \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/933/submission/35543519\" title\u003d\"Submission 35543519 by Juve45\"\u003e35543519\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["timus","geometry"]}}
