I was solving \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/536/problem/D\"\u003eTavas in Kansas\u003c/a\u003e and had some serious problems with debugging my solution. In the end, it was clear that the idea was correct, I just needed to focus on the implementation. I rewrote a small chunk of code and was astonished by the fact that it was equivalent, but it got accepted. I tried to play with my implementations a little. And guess what? I found out that assert() on an obvious condition can make your code work!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProof: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/536/submission/11050713\"\u003ethe failed submission\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/536/submission/11050711\"\u003ethe accepted submission\u003c/a\u003e (only with the assert added, where k should be 1).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI generally do not have great knowledge of compilators and stuff like that.
