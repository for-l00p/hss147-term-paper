This week and next week, there is a summer school, so I may not have as much time, but I will be free after that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe reason I want do this as group, I tried to do these algorithms myself, but sometimes I\u0027m stuck, cannot find problems or have hard time understanding algorithm. And sometimes when I cannot do problems, there is not even editorial (such as on SPOJ)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo here is list of algorithms I would like to cover:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eString Algorithms: Hashing, Suffix Array, Prefix Function, KMP, Z Algorithm\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGraph Algorithms: BFS/DFS, Dijkstra, Maximum-Bipartite Matching, Floyd-Warshall, Prim/Kruskal and MST\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDP: Most people know basic concept to DP. I guess devoting a week to DP is not enough and DP takes lots of practise, so I think it is best to solve a few DP problems every week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are also Data Structures, but right now, I\u0027m almost completely unfamiliar with that, so any suggestions of what to cover there would be appreciated. And if anyone else has other algorithms they think will be helpful, please post :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the way, if anyone has recommendations about the order of topics we should cover, please comment :) I think we should get started this week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
