And I am wondering.\u003cbr /\u003e What methods are used to calculate the binomial coefficients?\u003cbr /\u003e What is the most effective? \u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e I have used dynamic programming, although it is effective for many \u003cbr /\u003e queries and can be modulated with any number, the range is too limited. \u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e When the number is a bit higher, I have used modular arithmetic \u003cbr /\u003e but I need to precalculate all factorials and is needed a prime number \u003cbr /\u003e as a module and really the range is not so large just 10 ^ 5 maybe. \u003cbr /\u003e If the problem have higher numbers, I\u0027m lost \u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e Can you tell me what techniques you use and when they can be used are? \u003cbr /\u003e I hope you can help me \u003cbr /\u003e Thank you \u003cbr /\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
