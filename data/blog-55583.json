At first, I thought that writing problems is also fun, and becoming the writer is also a honor.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e But I saw about so many downvotes — even this may completely changed the writer\u0027s life.

Fortunately, there are no serious bug in my contests, and all official contests which I already wrote was rated. But any time any people can make mistake. So all of the writer always have probability to fail and get -500 downvotes, and finally they may die in competitive programming.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e What is your opinion?
