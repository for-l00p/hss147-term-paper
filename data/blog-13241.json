The website is a very valuable algorithm bank along with explanation and sample codes. The only problem is that it\u0027s all in Russian. I am sure Google translate can do a proper job in the easier algorithms but in the harder ones every word counts and it\u0027s usually not very sufficient.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have been thinking how valuable it would be if we have such a bank translated into English. To do that we basically need a Russian coder that knows English well and willing to do it. Translating all the algorithms will probably take some time and possibly nobody will be willing to give that much time with no return.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe plan we have in mind is the following:\u003cbr /\u003e - We find a good Russian coder with good knowledge of English willing to do the translation and ask him how much money he can do that for.\u003cbr /\u003e - We launch a kickstarter campaign targeting anybody who will benefit from the translation (which is basically any non Russian English speaking contestant) to collect the needed amount of money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll would be public and transparent. Do you think that would be successful??\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAre you willing to either do the job (if applies) or fund the campaign?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease let us hear from you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["emaxx"]}}
