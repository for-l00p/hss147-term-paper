Could someone give a hint on a couple of moments?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1) How one can assign both upper and lower constraints on the flow? Upper constraints will obviously be set by capacities, but how to deal with the lower ones?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2) In published solution (\u003ca\u003ehttps://gitlab.com/amirmd76/cf-round-366/blob/master/D/amd.cpp)\u003c/a\u003e, why author uses two networks? Besides, it is unclear, why additional vertices S and T are used, when source s and sink t are already defined?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3) Author mentions that we have two kinds of edges for red ones and blue ones. How it is realized there?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["flows","704-d","366","help"]}}
