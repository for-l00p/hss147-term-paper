The algorithm is as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1) Input the numbers in a vector \u0026quot;v\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2) Make a vector \u0026quot;primes\u0026quot; consisting of the prime numbers using Sieve of Eratosthenes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3) For every element in v, divide it by all primes smaller than it (if divisible).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4) Sort it\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e5) We will now have vector consisting of (1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,5,5,6,6,6,7 ... types) i.e. all numbers except of perfect squares (1 will be there) Now for the part I could not solve :\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e6) I want to arrange this vector thus formed of length n in such a manner that no 1\u0027s appear together, no 2\u0027s appear together, no 3\u0027s appear together ...etc. For example, the given case : {1,4,2} after step 3: {1,1,2} after step 4 {1,1,2} (since already sorted) after step 5 {1,2,1} is the valid arrays.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e7) I have to multiply this by a certain number but let\u0027s leave this for now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow can I solve the part 6).. ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#combination","#math","#advice"]}}
