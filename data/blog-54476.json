It always pleases me to see competitive programmers achieving heights beyond CP, in academia and \u0026quot;real-life\u0026quot; problems (recall that OpenAI\u0027s bot recently beat human players at 1v1 Dota2, with \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-red\" href\u003d\"/profile/meret\" title\u003d\"International Grandmaster meret\"\u003emeret\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-orange\" href\u003d\"/profile/Psyho\" title\u003d\"International master Psyho\"\u003ePsyho\u003c/a\u003e in the developers team).
