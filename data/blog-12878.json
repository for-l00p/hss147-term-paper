I\u0027ve searched for it and I found that I need to find the multiplicative inverse using extended Euclidean algorithm and I\u0027ve learnt it. I hope if somebody could tell me the fastest way to find C(n,m) mod P (P is a prime) using extended Euclidean algorithm and I would be thankful if there was a code. Thanks a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
