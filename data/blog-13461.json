Each statue is pointing in one of the following four direction North, South, East or West. John would like to arrange the statues so that they all point in same direction. However John is restricted to the following 8 moves which correspond to rotation each statue listed 90 degrees clockwise.

Each char is either \u0027N,\u0027S,\u0027E,\u0027W\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOutput: An integer which represents fewest no. of moves needed to arrange statues in same direction. If no sequence possible then return -1. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSample test cases: input: SSSSSSSS Output: 0 Explanation: All statues point in same direction. So it takes 0 moves \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTest case 1: Input : WWNNNNNN Output: 1 Exp: John can use Move A which will make all statues point to North \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTest Case 3: input: NNSEWSWN Output: 6 Exp: John uses Move A twice, B once, F twice, G once. This will result in all statues facing W.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["bfs","saurabh"]}}
