There is some description of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou are given set of points with size N. You should build polygon with minimal square without intersections that contain every point such a vertex of polygon. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt will be great if you attach your code :) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease give me any hints about it.
