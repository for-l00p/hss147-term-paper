However, we understand that this issue created unfair circumstances for other contestants, that could lose to those lucky ones that submitted in the described time frame.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have rejudged all solutions after the round, and tried to simulate how could the contest proceed should they have been judged correctly. Of course, any simulation of this kind cannot be accurate, and there is no completely fair resolution. We have decided to do the following:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1) Increase the number of Final Round participants to 55. It gives partial compensation to those participants who could have qualified but failed to do so because of someone\u0027s incorrectly small penalty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2) Increase number of t-shirts to 205. So all participants who have at least 3 accepted problems get our branded t-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJudges and the technical group of Russian Code Cup are sorry about the issue. We will do our best to avoid anything like that in future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGood luck to all finalists in the Final Round that will take place in September 2017!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
