Before users could add this information themselves, which led to duplicates, incorrect names, grammatical mistakes, etc. I parsed geodata, taking cities with population of 500+ people. It turned out there are more than 120,000 such ones. In addition, searching for cities has been improved â€” supported search by historical, national and other names.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThus, duplicates of cities were merged and random garbage was deleted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf for some reason your city has been inappropriately removed from the profile, try to set it again. If you can not find your city in the list, let me know about this and it will be added.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
