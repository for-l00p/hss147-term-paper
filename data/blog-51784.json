The problem is â€” There is a \u003cstrong\u003emaze\u003c/strong\u003e with floors and walls. \u003cstrong\u003eWalls\u003c/strong\u003e are represented by \u003cstrong\u003eblack\u003c/strong\u003e color and you cannot go there. You can only move on the \u0026quot;floor\u0026quot;. Also you can only \u003cstrong\u003emove either up or left\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe maze figure given is :\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/predownloaded/99/fc/99fce0b5fb34ecca529083cb4de4e6cc63459f8c.png\"\u003eMaze, my grundy numbers and correct grundy numbers\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the same figure above I have also shown my grundy numbers and the correct grundy numbers. And as you can see, mine are wrong. I think I am not undertanding the orange colored grundy numbers and that is from where all the error is started.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you please explain me where I am wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["game theory","grundy","sprague-grundy"]}}
