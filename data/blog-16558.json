Which to my surprise got a lot of upvotes. Hope to get lots of downvotes this time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo over this week, I actually posted some meaningful blogs, related to computer programming. Also I learnt to use the new features in C++14. For a long time I wanted to create a simple game, and I managed to make a simple ping pong game using pygame module. It also helped me get some more better understanding of python language.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eParticipated in Codeforces round 292. It was a nice contest with good and interesting problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegarding algorithms and data-structures, I made my concepts clear on suffix arrays and related areas and plan to solve some sums, and then read a bit about segment trees.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso I got to interact with many great people, and read some really nice blogs which increased my knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally thanks for reading.
