Just writing on this forum to recommend his book \u0026quot;Black Holes and Time Warps\u0026quot;. I think the audience here would really enjoy it, even though it is not related to computation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI read it years ago and hardly understand any of the physics or math but it was a wonderful description of how Hard Science is done, the people doing the work, their personalities and arguments, etc. Highly entertaining!! He described working with many other Nobel Prize winners â€” before they were such, even. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDr. Thorne is a great writer and he is also the executive producer of the movie \u0026quot;Interstellar\u0026quot;. Rare example of crossover between hard sciences and artistic fields.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["science","books"]}}
