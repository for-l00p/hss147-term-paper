I was thinking of using indicator random variables and linearity of expectation but somehow couldn\u0027t arrive at the answer. Please help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProblem: Given a number N, take any random permutation of numbers R \u003d [1, 2, ..., N]. You need to find the expected number of special points in the resulting permutation. An element R[i] is special if: \u003cbr /\u003e 1. R[i] \u003d R[i-1] + R[i+1] (for 1 \u0026lt;\u003di \u0026lt;\u003d N-2) \u003cbr /\u003e 2. R[i] \u003d 2*R[i+1] (for i\u003d\u003d0) \u003cbr /\u003e 3. R[i] \u003d 2*R[i-1] (for i\u003d\u003dN-1)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReturn the denominator and numerator of the answer.
