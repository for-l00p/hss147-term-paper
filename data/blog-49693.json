Your task is to find the maximal possible length of a king’s path (here we mean the length of the polyline, not the number of king’s moves).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSample Input \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eN\u003d1 ans\u003d0 N\u003d2 ans\u003d4 N\u003d3 ans\u003d9.414 \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am not able to get it , would you please help me understand to this ?
