You are also given the position of Runu. What is the minimum distance she needs to walk to get out of all the circles. More formally, if Runu\u0027s position is \u003cstrong\u003eP\u003c/strong\u003e and there is a point \u003cstrong\u003eQ\u003c/strong\u003e such that \u003cstrong\u003eQ\u003c/strong\u003e is out of every \u003cstrong\u003en\u003c/strong\u003e circles, you have to minimize the \u003cstrong\u003eeuclidian distance\u003c/strong\u003e of \u003cstrong\u003eP\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eQ\u003c/strong\u003e for all such \u003cstrong\u003eQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027s .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis problem is out of judges, came to my mind. Can you provide me a solution? What is the tight bound of \u003cstrong\u003en\u003c/strong\u003e then?
