I guess it\u0027s OK to discuss the problems here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt appears Ontology is not very difficult to most people. However, I don\u0027t even have a smart way to parse the parenthese-expression. All I did is just to generate a huge hash and transverse the relevant elements, and apparently it resulted in TLE. I wonder what kind of tree structure is recommended?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have the similar issue in best representing the problem with appropriate data structure in Wombats too. Even if I tried randomized optimization, it is hard for me to construct a stuffed animal removal sequence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat categories of algorithms do these two problems belong to? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["quora"]}}
