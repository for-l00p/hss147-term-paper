I like practicing in many fields of CP but many times I feel a bit bored or unmotivated because I am alone. I have noticed that if many people are in a group and solve same problems with same goals everybody work harder. So is anyone who has some group and wants to invite me or anyone who wants to join with me and create a new group ? Btw I would like to improve my english so it would be interested to have some talks about problems if you want.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for your time !\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
