Here is problem I recently encountered on \u0027Algorithm and data structures\u0027 course exam. The problem statement is:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou are given a sequence a1,a2,...,an, and a number b. Your task is to find algorithm which counts all pairs (l,r) such that median of sequence a(l),a(l+1),..,a(r) is bigger than b.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy solution on exam was O(n^2logn) which used order statistics tree. Other solutions were \u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eO(n^2) — used sorting to check median of pair in constant time\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eO(nlogn) — related to counting inverses in permutation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd surprisingly someone came up with O(n) solution. So here is my question, can anyone tell me about this solution to the problem? I\u0027m quite curious how this can be done in linear time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["median","exam"]}}
