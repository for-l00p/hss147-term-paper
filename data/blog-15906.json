How virtual judges determines that I am using freopen/fopen?  Interesting part is, I use \u003cstrong\u003e- #define filein(x) freopen(x,\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;,stdin)\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e- #define fileout(x) freopen(x,\u0026quot;w\u0026quot;,stdout)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eit compiles when I do not call them. but it gets compilation error when I use filein(\u0026quot;input.txt\u0026quot;); My question is, is it should be compilation error even though I use it!
