The contest test policy was first set to \u0026quot;Do not show\u0026quot;. After the contest started and some people submitted, I wanted to change the test policy to \u0026quot;Show failed test of own submission\u0026quot;. After I edited the contest to be like that, users are still unable to view the test cases in their submissions even if those submissions were made after I did my edit. Is there a way to allow participants to view their failing test cases? Do I have to create a new contest for that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have now tried to start a clone contest with the test policy set to \u0026quot;show failed test of own submission\u0026quot; and it still never shows the contestants their submissions test cases, just the code. Is there another option that needs to be adjusted for this to work?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["custom contests","#contest","codeforces polygon"]}}
