Assume the first book we\u0027ll read was in any position other than the top of the stack. So what will do is pay some cost to lift some books that were over it then place it on top of the stack so whatever position the book was, it\u0027ll return to the top of the stack, so the optimal thing to do is to place it there and not pay any cost. now for the second book we read, we know for sure that we\u0027ll read the first book first so it\u0027ll be in the top of the stack and we\u0027ll pay some cost to lift it. and after lifting the first book, we\u0027ll lift all the other books on top of the second and pay additional cost and at the end we\u0027ll place it on the top of stack so the optimal place for the second book is right under the first, because no matter its position it\u0027ll just end up on the top after we read it\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ecode \u003ca href\u003d\"http://pastebin.com/uPA5eWgV\"\u003ehttp://pastebin.com/uPA5eWgV\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
