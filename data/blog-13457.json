When I wanted to submit problem F (Cost of the Question), its name in the submission window included \u0026quot;NOT_SOLVABLE\u0026quot;. However, I got Accepted. So can anyone who has participated in that contest please clarify what does \u0026quot;NOT_SOLVABLE\u0026quot; mean? Was there a technical problem with this task\u0027s grader at some point? Or is the problem literally not solvable conceptually and the judge solution is wrong? The problem seems to have been solved during the contest and it\u0027s still in the standings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
