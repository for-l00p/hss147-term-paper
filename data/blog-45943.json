And preparing testcases for such problems inevitably involve building such graph. Also, there are so many problems involving trees, strings, arrays, and points on 2D or 3D space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI learned a few tricks for making such datas, including making a connected graph by first building its spanning tree, putting a few special trees(all points lying on a line, \u0027sea urchin\u0027 trees, sqrt(N) vertices having sqrt(N) neighbors) to cut out some suboptimal solutions, and such. \u003cem\u003e(Put it the other way, take a look at APIO 2013, the third task.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut somehow, it feels tedious to code the same things every time(yes, I\u0027m being lazy here), and I believe there are many ideas we can share to make the testcases better (and harder). I googled a little bit, but it seems there aren\u0027t one that\u0027s well-maintained.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think it\u0027d be good to have one that:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003ecan be run directly as a tool, or can be used as a library;\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eprovides templates for common structures and constraints;\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eits outputs should be easily formattable;\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003ecustom constraints can be easily added;\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eis open-source and well-maintained\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs there any?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["preparing problems","library"]}}
