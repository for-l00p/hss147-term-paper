My \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ideone.com/YKhqGP\"\u003esolution\u003c/a\u003e for problem DIV2C passed the pretests but didn\u0027t pass the system test. Because there was a bug in the line 65 \u0026amp; 66 because i had erased the iterator and then tried to use the value stored at it(i just replaced line 65 \u0026amp; 66 with each other, then \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ideone.com/vL5Uqu\"\u003esolution\u003c/a\u003e got accepted). So, it shouldn\u0027t have passed pretests even. but still it passed . Can someone explain me this abnormal behaviour of iterator. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
