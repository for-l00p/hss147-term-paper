Good Bye 2014 will be held for 2.5 hours with 7 problems, and it will be division conbined, like last year. However, I have a doubt about the normal score distribution 500-1000-1500-2000-2500-3000-3500.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/14102\"\u003eThis post\u003c/a\u003e already brought up the problems of the normal distribution. Solving Div1E at the last moment of the contest may be worse than solving Div1A very quickly. So I asked \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-red\" href\u003d\"/profile/Zlobober\" title\u003d\"Grandmaster Zlobober\"\u003eZlobober\u003c/a\u003e, whether the score leak (currently 0.4% per minute) could be changed or not, and unfortunately, there is no option to decrease the score leak currently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, I would like to know what would be the best score distribution for Good Bye 2014. I will consider all your opinions and set the score distribution.
