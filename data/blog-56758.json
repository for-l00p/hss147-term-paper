However, I usually have little time left to address problem D.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been working on more difficult problems and algorithms, but I never get to try them in contests as I\u0027m not able to solve A, B, C fast enough. What do you think is a good strategy to improve? should I try to be more fast on the first problems, or should I force myself to work on problem D in the contests?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
