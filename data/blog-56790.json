The next line contains an array of size n and next m lines contains two integers x and y each which represents that there exists a bidirectional edge between x and y. We have to output the number of permutations of the array which are lucky. A permutation is said to be lucky if for every Vi in the array there exists an edge between Vi and Vi+1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI/p: 3 2 1 2 3\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1 2\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2 3\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eo/p:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2(1-2-3 and 3-2-1)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
