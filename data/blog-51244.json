Such like \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/364/problem/D\" title\u003d\"Codeforces Round 213 (Div. 1)\"\u003e364D - Ghd\u003c/a\u003e. Unfortunately codeforces has only tag \u0026quot;probabilities\u0026quot;, which is usually used for problems where we have to calculate probability of something. Every time when I come across this kind of problem I am impressed how cool it is, so maybe you want to impress me? :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["randomization","nice problem"]}}
