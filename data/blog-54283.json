Today I\u0027ve tried to submit some solutions, and had the same issue again (\u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/848/submission/30041665\" title\u003d\"Submission 30041665 by limed\"\u003e30041665\u003c/a\u003e). Also, I found that more Scala users had the same runtime issue in the last few rounds (eg., \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/849/submission/29977952\" title\u003d\"Submission 29977952 by wrick\"\u003e29977952\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/845/submission/29706237\" title\u003d\"Submission 29706237 by aybekko\"\u003e29706237\u003c/a\u003e and more).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe error message is \u003ccode\u003ejava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: scala/App$class\u003c/code\u003e. Probably this could be caused by Scala standard library missing from the classpath.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI (and, I believe, other Scala users) would appreciate if this could be fixed. Until then, unfortunately, Scala is not usable on Codeforces :(\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["scala","runtime error"]}}
