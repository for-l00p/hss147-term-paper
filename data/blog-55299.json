I filled a vacancy at one of the good product companies here(which pays good) along with my undeserving university friends. This constant feeling of \u0026quot;I deserve more\u0026quot; made me hate my job and tried to look something better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as a matter of fact, this more than the couple of months of conventional Software development job made me realize that it isn\u0027t my cup of tea. I am performing poorly at an already boring job. Whenever I force my mind to learn something related to my current job, I end up in pages or youtube channels that perfectly explains the algorithm which could help me in solving a codeforces problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne thing CP taught me in my life is \u0026quot;Great things take time\u0026quot;. With due practice and hardwork, I could crack an interview at one of the tech giants like Microsoft or Google (which was my initial goal when i started CP) but what\u0027s next? I am still going to that boring job at a higher level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese struts,servlets,javascript and conventional software development doesn\u0027t excite me a bit. So what you guys think would be an ideal job for guys like me?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["competitive programming","sde"]}}
