So I thought this would be a good idea.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve created a mailing list for a study group here: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/icpc-2016-study-group\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/icpc-2016-study-group\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe idea is to create a study group where whenever we find a good problem that helped we learn something new in a good way, or some good materials to learn something, etc, we share so we can help each other prepare better for the ICPC this year. Or maybe motivate ourselves and push each other to work harder as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(For asking questions I think it\u0027s probably better to do it here because then more people can see it/learn from it, but maybe in a study group we can ask more \u0026quot;silly\u0026quot; stuff without being afraid as well lol).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyone that wants to join is welcome, but please contribute if you do so! \u003d)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["icpc","study","selfstudy","study group"]}}
