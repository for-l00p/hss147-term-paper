Now suppose you are level 3 user and you want your code reviewed then a member a level above you i.e. level 4 would review your code. However if you want your next code reviewed you have to first review the code of a member a level below you i.e. level 2. So everyone is benefitted. But the work on platform was stopped due to some reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow we are back and much better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe following are some of the main features added-\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e1.
