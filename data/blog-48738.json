IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO HELP PLEASE IGNORE IT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere i tried to maintain 4 order statistics set with value compresses be coordinate compression , one for row , one fo column ,one for additive sum of coordinates and one for the absolute difference of coordinates . Then to check whether a particular piece can attack the white piece in one move i am checking the domain in which they are identical ( 4 domains as defined above ) and then using pbds whcih is basically a set with additional functionalities i am checking the number of objects between cells . My code is passing on small cases but failing o test 5 . Can someone point the flaw in my approach ??
