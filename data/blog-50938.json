I think it would be nice to have a way to the community to step in and provide / improve existing editorials. For example by having wiki pages or allowing linking user\u0027s post to an existing problem (without beeing original problem setter or admin). Of course, that may lead to all problems with abuse but people here are way more reasonable than an ordinary forum.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think? Maybe that already exists and I am missing something?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["editorial","community"]}}
