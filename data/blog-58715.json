I mean why don\u0027t they publish all of the contestant\u0027s results, i.e. starting from score 0 to 1000. It would be great if they publish it in that way. Does anybody know the reason? Or can it be acquired easily?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["usaco","result","public","godblessamerica","need","answer"]}}
