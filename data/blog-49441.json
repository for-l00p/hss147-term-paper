Problem link -\u0026gt; \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/710/problem/B\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/710/problem/B\u003c/a\u003e The real reason to worry is that my code is passing one of the tests (where value of n is 300000) but is getting a verdict of TLE where (n is equal to 299999) .. How can this be posssible ?? I have used basic inbuilt sorting algorithm in Java and then one more step of O(n) complexity . So if n is larger , time will also be larger. As it will be directly proportional to O(n) or O(nlogn).. What is the reason behing this , that time is larger in latter case?? Infact , I then solved the problem in C++ where no such unexpected activity is happening and i passed all tests ..\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease help me out with this !!
