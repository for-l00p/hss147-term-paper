But being a beginner, I am not able to get progress in this. I\u0027ll be getting the expression like a string. I have generated a truth table using standard bitwise techniques, but not able to understand how to simplify such complex expressions. eg : (a+(b.c)).(d+e.f)+(g.(t+h)) here, alphabets are boolean var, and + represents bitwise OR , \u0027.\u0027 represents bitwise AND. Anyhelp will be appreciated :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#bitwise","#c++","boolean"]}}
