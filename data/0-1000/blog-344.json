I have two suggestions.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(1) I am often confused when the next contest will be held since the contest time is written for only one time zone. It would be convenient if there is a link to this world clock website,\u003cbr /\u003ehttp://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(2) I would like to know contest rules, but I can\u0027t find them. For example, what is the border between Div. 1 and Div. 2? If there is a web-page to explain about the basic rules, it will be useful.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThanks!\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["suggestions"]}}
