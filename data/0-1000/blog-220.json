It seems the problem D has some tricky issues around judge solutions. Judge solutions will be fixed and the problem will be rejudged. If it will affect many participants, the contest will not be rated.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eUPD 2\u003cb\u003e.\u003c/b\u003e We have reduced constraints in the problem D and made rejudge. No solution passed tests. So the rejudge affectedÂ significantly only 4 participants, who solved it during the contest. But all of them increase their rating if we will count the contest as rated event. So we decided to make it rated and put problem with lowered constraints into the practice.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cb\u003eUPD 3.
