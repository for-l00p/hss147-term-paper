In this contest, an user was generous enough to provide pastes of some of the problems in TopCoder. It was helpful as I couldn\u0027t access the problems on a regular basis even at the end of the contest. Would it be possible to provide a mirror of the problem statements at the beginning (or 5 minutes after the beginning) of a contest in case the server is unresponsive or simply slow?\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["cf beta round #15"]}}
