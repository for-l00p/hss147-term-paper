In this case, we use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, or the Edmonds-Karp, sometimes added to this scale, which significantly speeds up the case. The most difficult part of this problem is its attention to the calculation of the flow.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003eBut recently I came across a problem in the archive spoj\u0027a \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.spoj.pl/problems/FASTFLOW/\"\u003eFASTFLOW\u003c/a\u003e in which you want to calculate in a very small time a maximum flow with high input data. After writing the solutions in Java and getting TLE I rewrote it in C + +, but again, the Edmonds-Karp algorithm with scaling turned out to be powerless. No other methods I have never found, so the call for help. I think this issue will be of interest not only to me, because usually it does not cover too deep.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThanks in advance.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["max-flow min-cut","spoj"]}}
