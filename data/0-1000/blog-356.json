I use Visual C++ 6.0 which comes with visula studio 6.0. This has excellent debugging and the editor looks quite nice to me, no need to create project. But the problem is, while debugging i cant see the vector elements (same for other STL elements). Another problem is, __int64, i face lot of trouble for topcoder contests. Other editor like netbeans, eclipse and higher versions of visual studio etc requires creation of project, I do not like this. Spending time for creating project is just waste of time :P\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Java, Jcreator / JBuilder seems nice to me. They don\u0027t need project creation. But it seems to me that they are somewhat slower than C++, though some leading coders use java.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["contest","editor"]}}
