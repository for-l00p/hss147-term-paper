The problem seemed difficult at first and I had no idea how to approach it. As a start, I wrote a simple program to calculate the result for small inputs, and ... I saw a pattern! I guessed what the result could be, and after some tries I could get it Accepted!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI don\u0027t know if other people also solve problems by guessing or not.
