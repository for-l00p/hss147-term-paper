What did you like? What is not liked? What seemed uncomfortable? What can be changed to make participation more comfortable?  I wonder your opinion on contest web-interface. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"from-renderer\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"from-renderer\"\u003ePlease do not write about access the site with the address http://codeforces.com/ (I recommended to use http://codeforces.com:8081/). I guess the problem is around of Apache Virtual Hosts + AJP Connector. Something is configured incorrectly or doesn\u0027t work properly because , then it works so good. In short, I will correct. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"from-renderer\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"from-renderer\"\u003eI\u0027m waiting for your comments.
