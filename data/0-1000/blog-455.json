We want to find such allocation of exactly 10 stars to the cells with dots, at most one star per cell, so that each cell with a number has exactly that number of stars in its 8 adjacent cells. Moreover, we will only consider such 7 times 7 fields where such allocation of 10 stars exists and is unique.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCan you create a testcase for this problem that will kill backtracking solutions?
