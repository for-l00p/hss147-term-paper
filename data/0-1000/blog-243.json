There were some technical difficulties in the beginning, but the administrators successfully got rid of them. The server was quite snappy throughout and the problem statements were well written in my opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the solving side, I didn\u0027t do anything more than glance at problems D and E. Spent a lot of time debugging B, but couldn\u0027t find a failing testcase. Not even after generating random ones and comparing with a friend\u0027s correct solution. Problem C was also an implementation problem, yet I lost two penalty points there by 1) forgetting about 64-bit integers; 2) using %lld instead of %I64d in printf. Not to mention the time spent trying to figure out what (else) had went wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, still a very good format. 2 hours is probably short enough to devote my time to and the problems seemed to be well varied in terms of difficulty. I hope that I can clear the first three next time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["codeforces beta round #7"]}}
