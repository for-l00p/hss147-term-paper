It is difficult to read, which especially affects challenge phase. After I found something better, my rating grew from 1500-1700 to 2100. An ideal solution would be to use custom font (after all, humans are different). Unfortunately, tools for creating vector fonts are overcomplicated and/or expensive, and vector fonts are not needed at all in this case because the font needed will never go to printer or any other high resolution device. Raster fonts are very easy and fast to edit, but as you have might already guessed, Arena applet running under Sun\u0027s JVM does not allow to use them. I know that open JRE/JVM implementations exist. So, what is possible to do?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["fonts","java","тестирование"]}}
