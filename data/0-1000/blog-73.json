It will go according to the                   ACM-ICPC rules, but will                 last for 2                   hours. You shouldn\u0027t expect much from                   the problems - in the first place it      is organized                   to check the system function and your feedback. The                   problems      will be in two language: Russian and                   English. If I finish all the      preparatory work                   earlier, I\u0027ll bring the Round some two days forward.                   It\u0027s      planned to have the rating system at                   Codeforces similar to that at      TopCoder. If the                   beta-competition goes without system failures, the                   participants will get ratings. To take part you are to                   register first.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e               \u003cli style\u003d\"\"\u003e                 \u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe visual organization of “Recent                   actions” has been changed - \u0026quot;new                   comment\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;compose/edit      text\u0026quot;                   can                 be seen in the sidebar.

If                 you write relevant things, you get                 \u0026quot;plus\u0026quot;, if you\u0027re out of the topic, or act                 inappropriately - be sure, there will be people who\u0027ll                 give you \u0026quot;minus\u0026quot;. The weight of votes can be                 different, it depends on the user. At the present                 moment,               if your contribution is equal to                 or higher than +25, your               vote gets index 2                 (it\u0027s more complicated here, because               your                 contribution is based on the last month evaluations).

This will be a modified Elo, designed by me, Maxim Ivanov               (e-maxx) and Andrew Lazarev. From the outside it will               resemble the TopCoder rating system, which isn\u0027t               surprising,             because it\u0027s the Elo rating               adaptation .\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e             \u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it for now, I\u0027ll give the news               as             a UPD-section.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["codeforces","contribution","innovations","news"]}}
