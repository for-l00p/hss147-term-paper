In this post I would like to approach the problem of the code that is found in users\u0027solutions and it is not used. I understand that this is a method of speeding up the process of writing a solution, but it is really annoying when trying to hack. I know that on TopCoder there is a very strict rule about this ( maybe too strict if you ask me ) and that here there doesn\u0027t exist such a rule. I have seen this extra code before, but it didn\u0027t bother me. This time it was just too much. One person in my room had hundreds, if not more than 1000 lines of code, of which less than 100 were actual code for solving the problem. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eI\u0027m writing this, hoping that some rules wich would prevent this from happenning again will be taken into consideration by the CodeForces Team.         Thank you.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["code","extra"]}}
