Codeforces seems great :-) I like that people can blog in it, and I like that I have more time to solve problems than in topcoder. \u003cbr /\u003e I haven\u0027t competed much in programming competitions in 2009-2010, in fact I\u0027ve become \u0027unranked\u0027 in topcoder some weeks ago, which means I haven\u0027t participated at topcoder for more than 6 months. But I am thinking of starting to compete in competitions again, because it\u0027s one of the few things which make me feel \u0026quot;really\u0026quot; good. Some of the other such things that make me happy are: being with and thinking about my dear wife (yes, I got married 5 months ago :-), learning new things, and probably some kinds of music.\u003cbr /\u003e I hope I can compete in most of next matches. I guess I have to miss the next match because it is the same time as a university class :-(\u003cbr /\u003e I hope I can become a Marshall someday :-)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e Below you can see me fighting with a huge lion in China ;-)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cdiv align\u003d\"center\"\u003e \u003cimg src\u003d\"http://pykello.net/photo/fighting_with_lion.jpg\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["introduction","photo"]}}
