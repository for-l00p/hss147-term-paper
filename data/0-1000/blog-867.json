Can I please have some help? Thanks!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe first problem is problem B (School).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI have no idea how to do this problem. Actually, I dont really understand the question as well :(. Can someone help me?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eProblem C (Dancing Lessons):\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI wrote my code, but it keeps failing on testcase 11 and I dont know why. The outline of my algorithm is as follows:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFirst, I find all the immediate pairs of boys and girls and push them all into a set. The pairs in the set are sorted according to the conditions given.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThen, if the set is not empty:\u003cbr /\u003e1) I take the best pair out of the set.\u003cbr /\u003e2) If both members of the pair have not gone off for the dance yet, I add this person into the dance. Then, I add the pair that envelopes this pair into the set (for example, if I remove pair (4,5), I add pair (3,6) if this pair is available).\u003cbr /\u003e3) If one member is present, I expand it until I hit someone. Then I push it into the set.\u003cbr /\u003e4) If both members are gone, I just remove this pair from the set.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI keep doing this. Below is a link to my code.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ehttp://pastebin.com/qAipmk63\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCan someone help me and tell me what is wrong? :(\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThanks a lot in advance!\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["problem solving"]}}
