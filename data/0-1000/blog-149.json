Shortest path of the king\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s easy problem. But because I was afraid to get WA, I implemented this problem in BFS. So I wasted time :(\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eB. Lorry\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause of my poor English ability, I wasted time in this problem to read problem description and understand it. Though I understood the meaning of this problem, I was confused by bugs. And I wasted time again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eC. Tic-tac-toe\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI implemented brute-force algorithm to enumerate all valid game board. And then I implemented check of whether a player of either has just won. Then, I submitted the code.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen I was waiting for judge, I noticed that I had completely forgotten the case of \u0026quot;draw\u0026quot;.

Least Cost Bracket Sequence\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t solve this problem at the contest, and I can\u0027t still solve this problem now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["codeforces","report"]}}
