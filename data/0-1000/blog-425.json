I could have solved four, but I misinterpreted problem D\u0027s statement. I thought it asks us to find the minimal number of increasing subsequences and I don\u0027t know how to find that(yet).By the way if you know how to solve it leave a comment. As an example the answer for 1 2 10 4 5 11 9 is 2, that is 1 2 4 5 9 and 10 11.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eI\u0027m still struggling to find a O(n\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e) algo for the probability problem E. I saw that many had O(2\u003csup\u003en\u003c/sup\u003e) DP so I will try to check that out too. I\u0027m not too good at probabilities so it will take me a while until I will crack it. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eI can\u0027t wait for round 17!!!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["beta round #16","colors","increasing subsequence","lieutenant","probability","promotion"]}}
