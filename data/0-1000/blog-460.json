I went to look at the solution but do not really understand the solution, so I wonder if anyone here can help me. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI went to the COCI website (http://www.hsin.hr/coci/) and downloaded the solution and went to look at it, but I don\u0027t really get the solution. I ran it on the sample and this is what I got.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn the sample, there are 10 dwarfs:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e1 2 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 3\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet\u0027s assume that we have splitted the segments into (1,8) and (9,10). Let\u0027s call them segment A and B respectively. We see that A\u0027s candidate is 2 and the count is 0. We see that B\u0027s candidate is 3 and the count is 2. Therefore, when we merge these two segments, the candidate is 3 and the count is 2. But if we count the number of 3s, there are only three of them out of 10. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo am I missing something here? Is there some additional steps required that is not mentioned?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["programming"]}}
