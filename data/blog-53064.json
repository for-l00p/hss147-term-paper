This month I\u0027ve noticed something strange. Since the last 3 contests (2 from different ID), I\u0027m unable to solve problem B on Codeforces. Moreover, when I start coding, I don\u0027t feel my mind is \u0027fresh\u0027 enough to think creatively. Usually, I solve 2 problems in the contest, and then I try to upsolve C and D (Div 2) later. However, for some reason I feel I\u0027m not getting fresh ideas of late.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would like to know â€” has it happened with someone else? Has anyone experienced such a phase when you don\u0027t understand how to solve problems ? And how do you guys deal with such a phase.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is very shitty man.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
