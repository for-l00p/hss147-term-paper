The editorial link on the website is in Japanese, which I don\u0027t understand. Google translate doesn\u0027t give me a good translation or at least I cannot understand it. So can anyone share his/her solution to the problem or the solution from the editorial in english. Here is the problem for those that haven\u0027t seen it:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuppose we have a line and N(N \u0026lt;\u003d 10,000) pairs of points on it with coordinates (x_i, y_i). For each pair we can choose the first or the second point. We are to maximize the minimum distance between two consecutive points from the chosen(e.g when they are sorted on the line) which we can obtain by using different choices (whether to use x_i or y_i).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://atcoder.jp/img/arc069/editorial.pdf\"\u003eLink to japanese editorial\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["atcoder","points","distance"]}}
