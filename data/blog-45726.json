When I ran it on codeblocks it was giving the right answer but then I submitted and got a WA (even the custom invocation was giving wrong). I think that the judge used 0-indexed array by default. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the link to that submission: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/169/submission/18770974\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/169/submission/18770974\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I changed the code to 0-indexed and it passed.
