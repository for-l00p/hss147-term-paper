Consider the GCD of all the subarrays and print the no. of distinct GCD\u0027s found over all subarrays. A[i]\u0026lt;\u003d10^18.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am using the fact that for a fixed element A[i], GCD decreases as we increase the subarray length starting from element A[i]. So I considered all subarrays starting from index i and using binary search + sparse matrix(for range gcd) computed the indices where GCD changes and inserted the GCDs in a set and did the same for all other indices. But getting TLE. Please suggest some optimization or some other approach for this problem. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy code: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ideone.com/zeDVkD\"\u003ehttps://ideone.com/zeDVkD\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["array","gcd"]}}
