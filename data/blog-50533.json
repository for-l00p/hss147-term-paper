I m stating these statistic because i want to know what to do futher to improve my level, i can solve basic adhoc, dp, dfs problems but i do not know data structure like BIT, segment tree etc and i do not get many time to practice because of my job(i deliver pizza for a living). So i wanted to know how can i progress, anyone with a specific training method or specific set of problems is welcome to comment...Best comments, i will deliver pizza.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["help","improvement"]}}
