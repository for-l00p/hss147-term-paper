I am just really curious why every three contests we have some kind of problems related to the server ? I woke up at 6 30 am to participate in the contest and guess what again the contest is unrated. 8000 people have participated, as there are a lot of good coders I don\u0027t understand how codeforces is still having such problems. Codeforces is a really good website but it really needs to be maintained I guess, why are we still waiting ? I have never faced with any kind of problem in other contest websites. It is indeed and definitely time to do something about this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks, Respect to Draven.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
