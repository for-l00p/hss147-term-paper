Why is my segment tree so slow?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome problems like this -\u0026gt; \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/301/problem/D\" title\u003d\"Codeforces Round 182 (Div. 1)\"\u003e301D - Ярослав и делители\u003c/a\u003e , have the official solution, the same as the solution that I code but somehow my segment tree is always very slow. This has happened before in live contests as well . Maybe my implementation is very bad , that\u0027s why I want to learn where I am making mistake , and please provide me with a better implementation if I am making a mistake..\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy implementation to the above problem,using segment trees, which TLE\u0027s --\u0026gt; \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/301/submission/36075338\" title\u003d\"Посылка 36075338 от yaksha\"\u003e36075338\u003c/a\u003e .
