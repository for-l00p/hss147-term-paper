I scroll down to see that I indeed got some points on the test cases. Why is the result 0 points?

The links for the codes for the checker and interactor are in the description of that video. Also, is there a way to initialize testlib\u0027s RNG with a seed besides something like this?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003echar **ar\u003dargv;\nar[0][0]\u003dseed/256;\nar[0][1]\u003dseed%256;\nregisterGen(argc,ar,1);\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eEDIT: So, apparently testlib automatically puts a random seed to the command line. So, I removed the seed part of the interactor code, but of course the problem still persists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
