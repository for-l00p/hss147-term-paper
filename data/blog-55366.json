Memory?\u003c/p\u003e","locale":"en","content":"\u003cdiv class\u003d\"ttypography\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eHello! I have been solving Div2 D problem from the latest contest ( It\u0027s just simply BFS ) and faced with one strange fact. When I use two arrays in my solution I got AC with 1700 ms or more — \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/877/submission/31662651\" title\u003d\"Посылка 31662651 от Shudi\"\u003e31662651\u003c/a\u003e and it\u0027s near the TL \u003d 2000 ms. So, I decided to improve it and figured out that when I use only one array instead of two I got AC with 1388 ms — \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/877/submission/31662579\" title\u003d\"Посылка 31662579 от Shudi\"\u003e31662579\u003c/a\u003e. So, you can see that it\u0027s almost there is no difference between them in memory, then where is my 300 ms? Thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.S. Feel free to post your answers on Russian too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["memory usage","arrays","vectors","bfs"]}}
