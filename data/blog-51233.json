Trust me this doesn\u0027t take much time just 50 seconds after each sub-problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3) Readability is more important than most believe. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you learn to write simple readable code, you can code faster. The bugs will not occur as a messy code and if a bug occurs it will be faster to detect it and fix it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease share your experience, and correct me if I am wrong!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
