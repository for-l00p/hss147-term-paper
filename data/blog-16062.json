I \u003cstrong\u003eloved\u003c/strong\u003e solving this problem. It\u0027s a truly beautiful Eulerian Path problem in disguise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt also helped me refresh my knowledge on the algorithm. I learned Eulerian Paths/Tours like 10 years ago when I first started at the USACO Gateway and then I rarely ever used it again. Now I googled it to refresh my memory, but I couldn\u0027t come upon any good implementations out there. There are a few, but all of them seem either overly complicated or inefficient. No other algorithm I found out there beats the \u003cstrong\u003ebeautiful\u003c/strong\u003e recursive algorithm presented at the USACO Gateway.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor those not registered at USACO, you can view the tutorial here: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.google.com.ar/url?sa\u003dt\u0026amp;rct\u003dj\u0026amp;q\u003d\u0026amp;esrc\u003ds\u0026amp;source\u003dweb\u0026amp;cd\u003d1\u0026amp;cad\u003drja\u0026amp;uact\u003d8\u0026amp;ved\u003d0CB4QFjAA\u0026amp;url\u003dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.dcc.fc.up.pt%2F~pribeiro%2Festagio2008%2Fusaco%2F3_3_EulerianTour.htm\u0026amp;ei\u003d3U_IVLXWMM-HsQTt8ILYDw\u0026amp;usg\u003dAFQjCNHqwklyXrDD-aA5WXcgEBMdwK5XVQ\u0026amp;sig2\u003dfKjl73_FHpdNIlE8zxLbfA\u0026amp;bvm\u003dbv.84607526,d.cWc\"\u003eEulerian Paths/Tours Tutorial\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["euler","eulerian","paths","tours","trails"]}}
