I was trying to implement priority queue by myself, though I have used priority_queue from C++ STL many times. I was getting TLE for a very simple problem but when I used STL it got accepted. I believe time complexity of my priority queue for insert and pop() operation is O(log N) and overall complexity of solution is O(NlogN). please see the submission \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.hackerearth.com/submission/9455925/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["priority queue"]}}
