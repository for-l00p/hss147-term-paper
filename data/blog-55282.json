I wanted to know that does reference documents allowed. However when I checked the rules, it directs to \u0026quot;ICPC Regional Rules for 2017 Regionals\u0026quot; page and in \u0026quot;Regional Contest Computing Environment\u0026quot; part it says \u0026quot;Please see the specific regional rules at the ICPC Regional Contest Web Site\u0026quot;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, anyone knows about it? Can we bring printed documents or flash drive to be printed? I know I shouldn\u0027t be writing this two day before the contest but I couldn\u0027t find the rules and I don\u0027t know why but I didn\u0027t send an e-mail to contest director.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["seerc"]}}
