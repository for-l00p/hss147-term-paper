After the contest I copied the test case and run it on my machine using C++11. To my surprise the program terminated and produced what seemed to be a reasonable answer. I decided to send the same code with C++14 and it got Accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, because I thought that CF would get mad at me for trying to send the same source code as before, I went ahead and added a random comment line at the top and submitted using C++11. The solution passed. After some more experimenting I found that depending on what you write as the comment string you \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/721/submission/21056614\"\u003eget\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/721/submission/21063110\"\u003edifferent\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/721/submission/21063149\"\u003everdicts\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe original submission: \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/721/submission/21030683\" title\u003d\"Посылка 21030683 от ParanoidAndroid\"\u003e21030683\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther people have submitted the same code and got Accepted even with C++11: \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/721/submission/21074703\" title\u003d\"Посылка 21074703 от vjtheranger\"\u003e21074703\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/721/submission/21093103\" title\u003d\"Посылка 21093103 от RaifAkhmedshin\"\u003e21093103\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/721/submission/21094407\" title\u003d\"Посылка 21094407 от Phoom\"\u003e21094407\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would appreciate if someone could provide an explanation for this because I am baffled :D.
