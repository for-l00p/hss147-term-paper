It turns out that it is fast enough for one case, but could not run below 8 minutes for 100 testcases (as you can see in my screencast, it is an interesting race between 8 minutes countdown and my program). I downloaded several correct C-large solutions and they also run as slow as mine, but they parallelized the testcases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTIL : I should add multithreading libraries into my Codejam template.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
