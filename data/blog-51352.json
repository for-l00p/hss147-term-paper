They gave me links to solutions and they were similar. I don\u0027t know how anybody could get my code, i\u0027m afraid that my account was broken because my password was too weak. I have already sent two letters to the codechef administration, but i haven\u0027t received any answer yet. I really like competitions on the Codechef, and it is really sad, that they don\u0027t pay any attention to this problem. Did anybody have the same problem?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["codechef","ban","coolstorybob"]}}
