So, if the problem has diverse complexities (especially those involving sqrts), I have to “guess” the time limit, or submit any solutions that compiles :(\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, here’s my question : Is there any way to find the official time limit of main.edu.pl problem, without actually submitting to it?
