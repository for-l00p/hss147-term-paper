My favorite feature is solving challenges where most people seem to compete for getting shortest source code to given task (tasks are mostly easy so main challenge is usually solving it with a shortest code among all solvers). One issue I see is that Python solutions have big advantage since they are very short, also it is pretty annoying to see people copy-pasting solutions from each other, hopefully it will be given some solution soon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the way, users who perform good enough can post challenges themselves, would love to see new ones!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["codefights"]}}
