(a[i], b[i], n, m \u0026lt;\u003d 100)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI believe that there must be some mathematical trick to solve this problem but I could not find out myself. I hope that someone can help me with this. Thank you very much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother matter is, I wonder if there is a simple and fast way to compute (a[0] ^ (a[1] ^ (a[2] ^ (... ^ a[n]))) % MOD) for some MOD. All I can think of is to use Euler theorem a ^ totient(MOD) \u003d 1 (% MOD), but it seems pretty low. Can someone help me with this too?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you for your time and consideration. Happy Coding\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
