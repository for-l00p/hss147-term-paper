I was studying properties of the ancestors in the tree and solved a problem of finding the kth ancestor of any node in O(logK) time by pre-computing 2^jth parent of every node in O(NlogN) time. I am curious to know how can I apply this knowledge to find LCA of 2 given nodes efficiently?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["lca","#trees"]}}
