Some of these are still reliable, some are incomplete and some do not work anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, in the opinion of many, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.hackerrank.com/calendar\"\u003eHackerRank\u0027s calendar\u003c/a\u003e is the most \u003cem\u003ecomplete\u003c/em\u003e one since you can find almost any competition, and its always up to date for a few months ahead. However, my own personal problem with it is that it\u0027s not \u003cem\u003esound\u003c/em\u003e. In other words, it has too many competitions that I usually do not have time to consider anymore, which ends up with a lot of noise on own personal Google calendar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo in my attempts to create a more personalized calendar I found a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-filter-items-from-a-google-calendar-subscription\"\u003ebunch\u003c/a\u003e of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://productforums.google.com/forum/?hl\u003den#!newtopic/calendar/calendar/W8jpiJZ_2Gs\"\u003efeature\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"https://productforums.google.com/forum/?hl\u003den#!category-topic/calendar/sharing-and-inviting/3Eh9DfsM4iI\"\u003erequests\u003c/a\u003e for Google calendar to support filtering, or hide full day events, but these features are not supported, not even in the labs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I found \u003ca href\u003d\"icalfilter.com\"\u003eicalfilter.com\u003c/a\u003e which does exactly what I needed.
