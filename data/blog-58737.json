Now a blog post can be published or hidden in drafts separately from its translation. In case there is a published post, and its translation is hidden in drafts, or in the opposite case, you will see a corresponding warning about that. Also the logic of the Recent Actions was completely revised.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/7f/5b/7f5bf02ae1b37e260f7b30dbd9ffa90519d17a62.jpg\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eTalks (Codeforces)\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso added a new functional in the Talks. For some users, it was inconvenient if a talk with one person contains a lot of messages. The page Dialogues has been implemented. It contains all the dialogs, sorted by the time of the last message. For each dialog, only one row with the last message is shown. When you click the message the talk with this person will open. When you open talk with the person, all messages sent to you by the corresponding person automatically become read. The old-style talks page is also fully preserved. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eMathJax (Polygon + Codeforces)\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow to render statements and tutorials in Codeforces MathJax can be used.
