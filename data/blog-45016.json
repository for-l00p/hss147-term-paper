Every cell in the array stores three numbers. The objective is to determine if you can select a number (from the 3 given) for each cell such that all numbers are distinct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample:\u003c/strong\u003e Input: (1,2,3),(1,2,5),(2,5,6) Output: 1,5,6 (all of distinct, good)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInput: (1,1,1),(1,1,1),(2,5,6) Output: 1,1,6 (not all distinct, hence impossible)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny ideas how this problem could be solved in good time complexity? My ideas where to think of this as a graph problem. Maybe there is a greedy approach to this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["graph"]}}
