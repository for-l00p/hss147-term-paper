We know chords start degree and end degree. Find how many parts circle divided. Start of the coordinate system is located in center of the circle. 3 chords don\u0027t intersect at one point. Note: I made algorithm for that problem, but i couldn\u0027t write what i want. My algorithm: ans\u003dn+1+(count of intersects of chords with each other).
