For sake of learning i\u0027v been trying to solve it using prim\u0027s algorithm but it runs out of time. I was wondering if it\u0027s some inefficiency in my coding or it\u0027s the algorithm which can\u0027t solve the problem in given time? here is my last code submitted: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/888/submission/32616720\"\u003eMY CODE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ethanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["prim algorithm","efficiency","mst","xor"]}}
