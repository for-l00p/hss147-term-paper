Today, when I tried to look at a submission after locking it during the contest, I tried to double click on a cell, but double clicking didn\u0027t work. Similarly, double clicking doesn\u0027t work for me while viewing the results of past contests. Can anyone explain the issue? Thanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPD 1:\u003c/strong\u003e I tried viewing contest standings in incognito mode, and it actually worked! However, non-incognito still doesn\u0027t work.
