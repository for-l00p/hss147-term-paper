The graph is similar to \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/875/problem/F\" title\u003d\"Codeforces Round 441 (Div. 1, by Moscow Team Olympiad)\"\u003e875F - Royal Questions\u003c/a\u003e where nodes in one sides have at most 2 neighbours and the weight of these two edges are the same. However, each edge has 2 weights Ai and Bi, and the total weight is (sum of A)*(sum of B). The task is to find a maximum matching with highest total weight. N\u0026lt;\u003d10000 and A,B\u0026lt;\u003d30 where N is the number of nodes. Could someone give hints/solutions about this problem?
