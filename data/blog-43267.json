And I\u0027ll not be exaggerating when I say this but, I truly am bewildered by it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile solving the following question : \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/614/A\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/614/A\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI got a WA on Test case 39. When I decided to run the same code on Ideone, this is what I found:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCase 1 : I run the code as it as : \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/MLGW4I\"\u003ehttp://ideone.com/MLGW4I\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCase 2 : I add an additional printf statement, leaving the entire remaining code unchanged. : \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/X9kngM\"\u003ehttp://ideone.com/X9kngM\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe change can be seen (addition of an extra printf statement) in line no. 31 of the code.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow can it be possible that a simple printf statement changes the output that follows, when nothing is changed anywhere else? Or is it some pretty big blunder that I\u0027m making and am completely unaware of it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny help regarding this will be much appreciated. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
