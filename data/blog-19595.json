I need to have about 20 programming exercises (i.e. their statements) translated from English to Chinese, German, French. (this is for CodeAbbey site)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey are on average 100-250 words each (somewhat similar). I can offer small reward — about $25 per 10 translations — about 2 hours work for native speaker. Texts are in Markdown format. Few more technical details could be found \u003ca href\u003d\"https://github.com/codeabbey/translations\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e along with texts translated so far (but in different languages).
