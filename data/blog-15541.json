Do I need to register for the contest as in codeforces\u0027 rounds? And it also seemed like I can\u0027t use my own editor on arena. Do I have to use the coding area to code the solution? Is there an option or workaround not to use its built-in editor? I\u0027m also curios which one\u0027s (topcoder or codeforces) type of problems more similar to IOI?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["topcoder","codeforces","ioi"]}}
