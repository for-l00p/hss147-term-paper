Right now I am just trying to solve as many practice problems as I can. When I get stuck on how to implement a solution, I try and look around for other people\u0027s solutions. When I find a solution that I can make sense of, I will code it up pretty much line for line the same, work through it so I understand it, and submit it so I can keep track and make sure the implementation is correct. Obviously in a contest situation, this is not allowed but is it considered bad practice/cheating if I\u0027m just using the practice archives to submit others solutions? I don\u0027t want to get myself or others flagged if this is the case.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eedit: Looking back at a couple of my practice submissions, it seems like I actually have been doing a decent job \u0026quot;paraphrasing\u0026quot; the solutions of others I used, bar one or two instances where our codes were pretty similar. Hoping this is not a big deal as I\u0027m gaining nothing from it as its just practice archives and I\u0027m citing the true author in the comments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
