(For example \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/977\" title\u003d\"Codeforces Round 479 (Div. 3)\"\u003eCodeforces Round #479 (Div. 3)\u003c/a\u003e is held on Sunday 22:05 UTF+8)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am a student from China, I have to go to school early in weekdays. But if you set the contest time at weekday afternoons or Sunday afternoons, I can\u0027t take part in them because they are too late in China and if I join, I will feel sleepy the next day. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe only thing I want to suggest is that \u003cstrong\u003ecould you please hold the contest on Saturdays\u003c/strong\u003e , I think people won\u0027t work or go to school on Sundays so that they can join together, at least in China. thx\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
