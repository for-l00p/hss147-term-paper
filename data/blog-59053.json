I tried to come up with a solution but I reduce its complexity. The question goes as such: Given N rectangles of size(hi, wi)(rectangle i has height hi and weight wi), find the rectangle with the smallest area that can fit all the other rectangles without them overlapping. You can rotate the rectangles. N, wi, hi \u0026lt;\u003d10^4 I\u0027m open to any kind of discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["geometry"]}}
