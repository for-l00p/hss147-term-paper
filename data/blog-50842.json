I received positive feedback on it, and seeing that there is no blog on Codeforces about Min-Cost Flow, I thought of uploading my presentation here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease note that there are also some problems for you to try on the summary slide.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny suggestions for problems on min-cost flow from Codeforces are very welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can find the presentation \u003ca href\u003d\"https://drive.google.com/open?id\u003d0B4Vakqjg6oPeNm13R2JVWkNERGM\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["mincostflow","presentation"]}}
