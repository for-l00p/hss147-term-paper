I managed to find \u003ca href\u003d\"http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module\u003dStatic\u0026amp;d1\u003dtutorials\u0026amp;d2\u003dbitManipulation\"\u003ethis one\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.vipan.com/htdocs/bitwisehelp.html\"\u003eanother one\u003c/a\u003e . But I found none of them explaining all the concepts related to the topic. I could not solve even a single question on DP with Bitmasks after reading them. Can somebody provide me some good resources where I can get some good code snippets with proper explanation as to how the code uses Bitmasks and how it is working for a problem. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks!!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["bitmasks","dynamic programming","tutorials"]}}
