I just wanted to know that is there any algorithm for finding frequency of any number in a particular range in an array?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe use Mo`s Algorithm for finding max frequency in a range but is there any other one which is faster for this particular problem of mine (calculating frequency of any number)?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI tried writing an algorithm for it but I believe its too slow to pass in one second. Although I think that my build takes O (n log n) time and queries come out in O (log n) time but I believe it\u0027s the uncertainty of hashing that`s making the algorithm slower.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is my code â€” \u003ca href\u003d\"https://pastebin.com/Ypj90749\"\u003ehttps://pastebin.com/Ypj90749\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote- Please do not tell me the solutions of the codeforces problem. I have already read the editorial and their implementation is pretty simple. I just want to get an answer for my curiosity to be able to learn a new beautiful algorithm (if there is) and help some other learners like me. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
