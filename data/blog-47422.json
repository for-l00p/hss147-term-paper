Many people think C# allows competitors to write cleaner (in comparison with C++) and shorter (in comparison with JAVA) code. There was the main problem with C# mentioned in almost all discussions: .NET wasn\u0027t open source and it required Windows for good performance and IDE.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith developing Visual Studio Code and announcing .NET Core 1.0 these problems seem to be gone.
