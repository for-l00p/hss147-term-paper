Since problem statement isnt that long, I decided to include it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNikhilesh loves factorials. One day he was working on exponents and starts wondering what would be the exponent of a number in the factorial of another number. He defines a function Exp(N,k) as:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eExp(N,k) \u003d largest Y such that kY is a factor of N! .\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHe calculates Exp(N,k) for all values of k from 2 to N .\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSince he is bad at remembering numbers, he computes the sum of Exp(N,k) for all k in range [2,N]. This sum is easy to remember.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYour task is to calculate this sum for a given value of N. Since the value can be large, print its modulus with mod (ans%mod).\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI used miller rabin primarility test for generating primes. Then I factorised every number upto N, stored it in a place. Then I found out the frequency of each element and stored it along with that element in a pair. So I had all the prime factors and exponents of the factorial, which I used to solve the question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever this is extremely slow for large input.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny other feasible method ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/mathletics/challenges/playing-with-factorials\"\u003eLink To Problem\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["factorial","primes","math"]}}
