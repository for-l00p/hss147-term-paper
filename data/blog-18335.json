So I wrote a JAVA code that calculates the number of submissions I did (you can choose the x axis range. It can be per day for 50 days or per week for 50 weeks or whatever). This project is available for everyone. Just mention your \u0026quot;frequency required\u0026quot; and your handle and behold, it gives you your performance. It counts unofficial submissions too. Calculates how many submissions you did and in that how many were correct. Some error handling or exceptions were not done. Sorry for that part.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDownload the .jar file here from \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/f8eo2zmm2dhisj8/CodeforcesReview.jar?dl\u003d0\"\u003eDROPBOX\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease tell me if either you want to improve this or you have some issues.
