And I read that it is equivalent that when we are performing these operations, to consider a[i] as a double, transforming a[i] //\u003d 2 to a[i] / 2, and then at the end taking the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is a little obvious, but nevertheless very surprising to me. Can someone prove it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["smile","sweet","service","surprise"]}}
