I have thought about this for some time and then looked at some clues for the problem because I could not come up with a solution. My understanding is that this is a special case of \u0026quot;Bin Packing\u0026quot; problems which in general are NP-Hard. Looking at this idea in particular \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/13781\"\u003eCodeForces Blog\u003c/a\u003e, I am unable to understand why this even works optimally here. In particular how can we prove that this algorithm is optimal ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["codejam","knapsack","greedy","np-hard"]}}
