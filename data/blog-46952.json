I want to start a club for it and I\u0027m talking with professors and other organizations to see who wants to support me. I think I\u0027m going to start a meeting with people that are interested this week and explain what ICPC is. I\u0027m not really sure on how to get it started. Any tips?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#acmicpc","help"]}}
