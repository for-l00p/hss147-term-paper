Whenever I need such an algorithm, I just copy-paste the same well-tested implementation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is my personal collection of algorithms and data structures, which have been in use during the last few years on hundreds of problems and two ACM-ICPC world finals. My favorites are FFT, suffix array, and convex hull.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope they will inspire you to write your own library or serve as a learning resource.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEnjoy!
