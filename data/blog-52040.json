The interesting thing is that I submitted 2 buggy solutions before: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/91/submission/27178776\"\u003e27178776\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/91/submission/27178719\"\u003e27178719\u003c/a\u003e. They are exactly the same, but one is compiled on C++11 and the other on C++14. My question is: why is there a difference? Does it have to do with the way C++11 and C++14 handles the way a vector works when you access the vector.size()th element (which doesn\u0027t exist)?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
