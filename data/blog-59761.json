As we all know, in order to unlock an Ambroid device, one needs to draw a pattern connecting the given dots. The developers of Ambroid OS want this pattern unlock to be more secure. So they are wondering, in how many ways, can we draw a pattern by connecting dots.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven N points (dots) in the co-ordinate system, find and return the number of ways in which, we can draw a pattern by connecting dots.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA pattern is a sequence of distinct dots where two adjacent dots in the sequence are connected by a line segment and should satisfy following conditions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003eA pattern should connect at least two dots.\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eWhile connecting two dots A and B, suppose there is a dot C which has not yet been connected and lies on the line segment joining A and B, then you cannot connect A and B without connecting C in between, that is, pattern A-C-B and pattern B-C-A are valid but the patterns A-B or B-A are not valid as C has not yet been connected.\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInput\u003c/strong\u003e 2\u0026lt;\u003dN\u0026lt;\u003d16 0\u0026lt;\u003dx,y\u0026lt;\u003d200\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI only know the obvious n! solution.
