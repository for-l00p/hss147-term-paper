As a part of a task in the hunt Timo has to visit some malls in the city.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eN malls were situated in a row. Timo has to visit K malls. But as she is running out of time she does not want to visit two consecutive malls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow many different combinations of malls should Timo consider? Input\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first line contains an integer T — the number of test cases. Next follow T lines, each containing two space separated integers, N and K.
