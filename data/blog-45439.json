A simple solution can be as follow : . we have segment always begin at 1 and end at n . so to get how many number are dividable by a answer will be n/a . and to get how many number are dividable by b answer will be n/b . now we have overlap for example if n\u003d20 and a\u003d2 and b\u003d3 . number that dividable by a will be 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20 . number that dividable by b will be 3,6,9,12,15,18 . as we see 6,12,18 are overlap to get number of these overlap we should know . first overlap to do that we should get LCM least common multiple . a*b but in simple form so we divide on gcd(a,b) so LCM\u003da*b/gcd(a,b) . so finally equation will be n/a + n/b — n/LCM(a,b) . to get maximum profit we should multiple common numbers in maximum profit . so finally equation will be n/a*p + n/b*q — n/LCM(a,b)*min(p,q) . code in c++ : \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/YEZV1P\"\u003ehttp://ideone.com/YEZV1P\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href\u003d\"http://codepad.org/SA2a5RUu\"\u003ehttp://codepad.org/SA2a5RUu\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
