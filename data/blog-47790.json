So, I and my roommate decided to do something entirely new. We went to learn Swift, developed an iOS app, and published it on App Store a couple of days ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was a really good experience and I felt that my programming have turned from black and white, to colourful. In fact, instead of just thinking about optimality and speed of your code, you will think about how to make your app more popular/addictive. Also, I really enjoyed programming with Swift!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you think that you ever reached a dead-end in programming like me, writing a simple app is a different experience. It\u0027s worth a shot!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eApp name: “The Ultimate Brainstormer” Link: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://appsto.re/ca/mUTwfb.i\"\u003ehttps://appsto.re/ca/mUTwfb.i\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["ios","app","brainstorm"]}}
