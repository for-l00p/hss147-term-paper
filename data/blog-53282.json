In that solution there is an extra \u0027cin\u0027(in line 4th in int main) in the code which is wrong if n\u003d1 and I think it has to show TLE in that case. I tried test case as follows 1 7 which outputs YES in original case but in that I think the compiler has to wait for another input y but my hack got unsuccessful. Don\u0027t know the reason. Can somebody please tell me whats wrong in it? Attached is the link to the code I tried to hack : \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/831/submission/28514528\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/831/submission/28514528\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
