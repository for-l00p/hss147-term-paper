For instance,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003ewhat specific types of problems, algorithms, or data structures, etc., should we be familiar with?\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eBesides algorithmic skill, what specific programming skill do we need to obtain?\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, if you know helpful resources, such as tutorial, books, websites other than Codeforces, Topcoder, please share them. I think a lot of people, like me would be very grateful for your help. Thanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["training","suggestions","advice"]}}
