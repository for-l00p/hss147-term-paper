I have seen solutions of this problem but I still don\u0027t understand how it works :(. I will be using term SGN as Sprague-Grundy Number. If a pile has 3 stones what should be its SGN? my analysis says it should be like-\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e   \u003cul\u003e     \u003cli\u003eSGN(1)\u003d0,\u003c/li\u003e   \u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e   \u003cul\u003e     \u003cli\u003eSGN(2)\u003d mex(1) \u003d 1, since we must have to take 1 stone, we have only one choice\u003c/li\u003e   \u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e   \u003cul\u003e     \u003cli\u003eSGN(3)\u003d mex(1) \u003d 1, since we must have to take 1 stone, we have only one choice\u003c/li\u003e   \u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e   \u003cul\u003e     \u003cli\u003eNow the solution to this problem I have seen says SGN(3) is 0 which unfortunately, I don\u0027t understand how :(\u003c/li\u003e   \u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eI have just started to learn Sprague-Grundy Number.
