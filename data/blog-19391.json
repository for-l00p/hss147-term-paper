Distance between images is a measure of how similar they are (the smaller the difference, the more similar are the images). Now, I want to create a pictorial collage with all the images that will group all the similar images next to each other. The more similar the images, the closer they are to one another.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first step I\u0027ve thought of is to create connected components by setting a threshold for distance, and removing all edges above this distance. I still haven\u0027t figured out a good way to place the images within each connected component.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny ideas, or references to look at?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
