Firstly, I\u0027ve looked \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-violet\" href\u003d\"/profile/PrinceOfPersia\" title\u003d\"Candidate Master PrinceOfPersia\"\u003ePrinceOfPersia\u003c/a\u003e\u0027s \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/15890\"\u003etutorial\u003c/a\u003e, but there wasn\u0027t much about 2d segment trees; that\u0027s why I\u0027ve researched a little bit and found \u003ca href\u003d\"http://kaidul.com/2d-segment-quad-tree-problem-solving/\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e blog. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though, \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-violet\" href\u003d\"/profile/PrinceOfPersia\" title\u003d\"Candidate Master PrinceOfPersia\"\u003ePrinceOfPersia\u003c/a\u003e\u0027s tutorial doesn\u0027t tell much about 2d segment tree, it says that every node in main segment tree is also a segment tree. On contrary, other blog describes a totally different idea. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan someone explain me (or point out a website that explains it) the idea represented in \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-violet\" href\u003d\"/profile/PrinceOfPersia\" title\u003d\"Candidate Master PrinceOfPersia\"\u003ePrinceOfPersia\u003c/a\u003e\u0027s tutorial and compare (complexity, usages etc.) these two different approaches? Also, it looks like range update with lazy propagation would work with a quad tree. Is lazy propagation possible in other one?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUPD: Thank you really much for good answers! They\u0027re really useful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["segment trees"]}}
