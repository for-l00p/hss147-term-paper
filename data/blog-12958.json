Muy first thought was something like (k-2)^N por something Of the like, but that clearly doesnt work. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf have be en writing things down, but i cant see the pattern. I know also it has to be linear with respect to n.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks a bunch!!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["uva","combinatorics"]}}
