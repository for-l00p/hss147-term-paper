But if you go in the same problem in div1 it appears again as \u0026quot;green\u0026quot;, but when you click to the problem you can\u0027t see the submissions that happened in same problem in div2. That makes harder to see your own previous submissions for that problem, and also you can\u0027t see submissions of your friends because maybe they have submit that problem in other division. Is any way to fix that ? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
