The proof of the transitivity also belongs to him. Let\u0027s sort all the strings by comparator a + b \u0026lt; b + a and concatenate them. Let\u0027s prove that it\u0027s the optimal answer. Let that operator be transitive (so if ). Consider an optimal answer with two strings in reverse order by that operator. Because of the transitivity of operator we can assume that pair of strings are neighbouring. But then we can swap them and get the better answer. Let\u0027s prove the transitivity of operator. Consider the strings as the 26-base numbers. Then the relation a + b \u0026lt; b + a equivalent to . The last is simply the relation between real numbers. So we proved the transitivity of the relation a + b \u0026lt; b + a.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t understand a word of it.
