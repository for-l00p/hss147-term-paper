Each rectangle has coordinates in [-10000, 10000] and there are N ( N \u0026lt;\u003d 5000) rectangles. I\u0027ve looked up solutions online, but I\u0027ve had trouble finding a solid implementation, and my past ideas have all failed. I know I want to use some kind of N^2 sweep line, but I can\u0027t figure out what to do at each event. Can someone help guide me through this problem? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#geometry","line sweep","sweep line"]}}
