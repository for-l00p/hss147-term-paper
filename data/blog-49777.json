Today I will hold a workshop session on data structures for the Estonian olympiad students and I decided to create tutorial slides on persistent segment trees for the especially advanced ones. The goal was to rely more on visual illustration than text.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe slides are \u003ca href\u003d\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwGLW04WRv0ITEZjRWlMSFc2bk0/view?usp\u003dsharing\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope they can be useful for some of you. Any feedback will be very welcome, also if any of you know some good persistent segment tree problems on the codeforces platform, then that would be helpful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["data structures","persistent segment trees","segment trees","tutorial"]}}
