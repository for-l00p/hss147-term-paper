But currently we don\u0027t find any better solution by ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecently we(me \u0026amp; \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-cyan\" href\u003d\"/profile/rifat2704\" title\u003d\"Specialist rifat2704\"\u003erifat2704\u003c/a\u003e) were learning matching / flow related topics. But we have found that, these topics are hard nut to crack. We know some algorithms like, Hungarian algorithm for matching, Edmond Karp etc. But we failed to find a friend who knows flow / matching related topics well enough to clear our confusion in some areas. If you have enough time to help us, kindly message in private so that we may discuss the topics over video / voice call over any social networking site.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance for your kind help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["flow"]}}
