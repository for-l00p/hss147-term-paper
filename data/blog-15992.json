My teammates have recommended this site to me and I have registered here today. This site looks great so far :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyway, back to the original topic. As graph theory is an important component in IOI, I\u0027m currently preparing hard for it. I know that direct implementations of the standard graph algorithms will not be tested in IOI, so I\u0027m trying to think of variations and applications of some standard algorithms. I have thought of these so far for MST and Dijkstra.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eMST\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eFind number of unique MST\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eFind MST that doesn\u0027t use a certain edge/certain edges\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eMinimum Spanning Forest\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eSecond best spanning tree\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eDijkstra\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eFind number of shortest paths\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eFind shortest path with minimum/maximum/certain number of edges for a weighted graph\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eFind shortest path that passes through a certain vertex/certain vertices/a certain edge/certain edges\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eSecond best shortest path\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would really appreciate it if anyone can help provide descriptions of possible solutions for the above variations.
