I really like the website. It would have been great if the code we wrote ran in a 64-bit environment as opposed to a 32-bit environment. I use Rust and got bit assuming usize was 64-bit. I had to explicitly use u64.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am solving the problems at codeforces in descending order of num-solved. So, I am solving the easier problems first. I like the fact that the problems have tags letting you know what to expect in the problem. Even the so-called easier problems are not too-easy, there is usually a trick or two to get the problem right. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you are a Rust enthusiast (or not), consider adding me as a friend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHappy Problem Solving! 20180319_25.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
