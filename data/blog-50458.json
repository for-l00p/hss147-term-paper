Each cell contains a number K (0 \u0026lt;\u003d K \u0026lt;\u003d 10^5). Currently we are at cell (1,1) and we need to go to cell (N,M).We pick each number that is present in the current cell as we proceed along the path. Transitions are as follows:  From position (r,c) we can go to (r+1,c) or (r,c+1) or (r+1,c+1).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe need to print the cell positions of lexicographical largest path among all possible paths. example :\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1 2 3\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4 5 6\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e7 8 9\u003cbr /\u003eIn above matrix path [(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)] is largest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance ...\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["grid","lexicography"]}}
