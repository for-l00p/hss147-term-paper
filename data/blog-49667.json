I also added some nice features(Check out the side bar ;)). Its mainly aimed for beginner programmers for now, as I am not as good myself, but I will improve the quality of post overtime. Please, check out my blog and give me suggestions on what should I post about, any improvements and so on. Your feedback will be invaluable for me. Also, if I could help anyone understand any of the topics they were struggling with, it would be a great deed for me.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThank you in advance.
