Such a coincidence is a clear rules violation. Note that unintentional leakage is also a violation. For example, do not use ideone.com with the default settings (public access to your code). If you have conclusive evidence that a coincidence has occurred due to the use of a common source published before the competition, write a comment to post about the round with all the details.

The solution mentioned is not even similar to mine, it is in Java and my is in C#! There is absolutely not a chance we copied each other. And how can \u0026quot;Such a coincidence\u0026quot; be a rule violation? How am I supposed to write code avoiding such a coincidence to not break the rules!?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo do I need to do anything to fix this or can I just ignore it?\u003c/strong\u003e Is there a chance I will be blocked if this happens again?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
