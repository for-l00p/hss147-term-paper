Given a number n , we have to find its other two Pythagorean Triplets. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy approach was as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI stored the factors of n in a vector. Since we have n*n to deal with, I basically decomposed n*n into all possible combinations of any two of (n*n)\u0027s factors p,q such that p*q \u003d n*n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003enow, a*a +n*n \u003d c*c\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003d\u0026gt; n*n \u003d (c-a)*(c+a) \u003d p*q\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow assuming min(p,q) \u003d c-a and max(p,q) \u003d c+a, I just checked if the Pythagorean equation is satisfied. \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/707/submission/19990014\"\u003eMy code\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat I still can\u0027t figure out in my own code is how my solution gives a correct answer if n is a hypotenuse. I have not handled the case x*x + y*y \u003dn*n. My code seems to prove that if x*x + y*y \u003d n*n, then there always exists a,b such that a*a + n*n \u003d b*b. Simply speaking, hypotenuse of any right angled triangle is always cathetus of some other right triangle. Does this always hold true or is there a counter case. A proof from someone would be really helpful. Thanks :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["pythagorean triplets","trigonometry","maths"]}}
