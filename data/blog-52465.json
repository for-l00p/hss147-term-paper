So it will give us answer in NO of Query * O(log(abs(R-L+1)).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Can some one please suggest me \u003cstrong\u003ehow can i can calculate ONLY F(L,R,X) by using SEGMENT TREE\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/459/D\"\u003eProble Link\u003c/a\u003e.....\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks In Advance..!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["divide and conquer","segment tree"]}}
