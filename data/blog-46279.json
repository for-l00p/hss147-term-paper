I mean anything you need to know to reach the world finals :D \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, yesterday i discovered that all my training was useless, when I participated in the Nationals in my country, a problem set with 12 problems, NO graph!!! one dp problem but it was about 80% geometry 20% dp, another three geometry problems, NO data structures, NO real algorithms, just a punch of some silly \u0026amp; hard implementation problems, that requires no thinking, but just coding for hours!!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I want to help the new Acmers in my country by suggesting adding \u0026quot;3tes\u0026quot; tag to Codeforces tags, so that new Acmers won\u0027t waste there time by training with stupid \u0026amp; useless algorithmic problems, just solve \u0026quot;3tes\u0026quot; problems and you will reach the WF for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-admin\" href\u003d\"/profile/MikeMirzayanov\" title\u003d\"Штаб, MikeMirzayanov\"\u003eMikeMirzayanov\u003c/a\u003e although most codeforces problems are awesome and great, but i can help you choosing some \u0026quot;3tes\u0026quot; problems like \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/689/A\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/676/problem/D\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e perhaps this might help the new Acmers in my country...\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["3tes","if you know what i mean",":("]}}
