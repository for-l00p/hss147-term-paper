I think the problem for me is, I don\u0027t have proper knowledge of the concepts and data structures that I need to know at this level. So, could anyone point me to or supply me with a list of topics that come up frequently on Platinum contests (and perhaps some simple problems where I can practice and learn these new concepts)?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks!
