In case there is more than one solution then find the solution that gives the largest perfect square. Assume that each integer contains five or less number of digits. The total number of integers in the given set is twenty or less. You are required to write a program for a problem as simple as this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInput The input may contain multiple test cases. For each test case there is a single input line. The line contains the given set of integers. The input terminates with a line containing 0 as input. Output For each test case there is only one output line. The line simply prints the integers to be deleted in ascending order. There are two special cases; print output for these cases as indicated below.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCase 1: No integer is to be deleted: Print `0\u0027 as output.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCase 2: All integers are to be deleted: Print all integers in ascending order.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSample Input\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2 3 12 18 24\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e12 10 15 18\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4 12 10 15\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e10 12 15\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSample Output\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e24\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e10 12 15\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e10 12 15\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/external/44/4467.pdf\"\u003ehttps://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/external/44/4467.pdf\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#acmicpc","array","advanced math"]}}
