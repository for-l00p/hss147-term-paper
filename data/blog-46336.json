Doesn\u0027t the caterpillar slip below ground level the first night and then catch the apple the next day. In the first day he is at height 801 cm but then at night he drops 1188cm (which would put him below ground). Could someone please explain why my assumption is wrong as the note in the problem announcements is unclear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLink to problem:\u003ca href\u003d\"//www.codeforces.com/contest/652\"\u003ehttp://www.codeforces.com/contest/652\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLink to Submission:\u003ca href\u003d\"//www.codeforces.com/contest/652/submission/19505251\"\u003ehttp://www.codeforces.com/contest/652/submission/19505251\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProblem announcement note:\u0026quot;Note that the forest is magic so the caterpillar can slip down under the ground and then lift to the apple.\u0026quot; means that it is possible to slip down under the ground, but then lift to the apple.
