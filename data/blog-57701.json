Now trying to solve \u003ca href\u003d\"http://lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem\u003d1296\"\u003elightoj 1296 — Again Stone Game\u003c/a\u003e this problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlice and Bob are playing a stone game. Initially there are n piles of stones and each pile contains some stone range[1,10^9]. Alice start the game and they alternate moves. In each move, a player has to select any pile and should remove at least one and no more than half stones from that pile. Who will win the game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think it\u0027s not possible to solve by Dynamic Programming. Need to find out a pattern. I just calculate some values Sprague-Grundy Number and find a pattern for even number that each even number Sprague-Grundy Number is its own half. (I using term SGN as Sprague-Grundy Number). Like it – \u003cstrong\u003eSGN(2) \u003d 1, SGN(4) \u003d 2, SGN(6) \u003d 3, SGN(8) \u003d 4.\u003c/strong\u003e........\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor some odd numbers it \u003cstrong\u003eSGN(1)\u003d0, SGN(3)\u003d0, SGN(5)\u003d1, SGN(7)\u003d0,SGN(9)\u003d2.\u003c/strong\u003e........ But I could not find out any pattern for odd numbers. I can not understand that my observations is right or wrong. Looking help for odd values pattern or a new hints to solve this problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance………………………….\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["game theory","sprague-grundy"]}}
