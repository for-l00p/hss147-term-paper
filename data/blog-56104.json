I have been experimenting with Python for CP lately. I read from various sources, including \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/21851\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e, that running Python code in PyPy 2 will speed up runtime by a lot as compared to the Python 2 interpreter. \u003ca href\u003d\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45117672/pypy-large-memory-usage-compared-to-cpython\"\u003eTests\u003c/a\u003e that I performed in the SPOJ enormous input test seemed to confirm this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI recently tried to solve another problem on CodeForces using Python. I submitted the \u003cstrong\u003eexact\u003c/strong\u003e same code using both PyPy 2 and Python 2 options. However, the PyPy option clearly got TLE while the Python 2 option got AC comfortably.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy submissions using \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/352/submission/32810003\"\u003ePyPy 2\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/352/submission/32809940\"\u003ePython 2\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am unable to explain this contradiction as I am new to Python. Is any Python expert here able to explain this strange occurrence please? Thanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#python","#pypy"]}}
