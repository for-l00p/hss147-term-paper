It was indeed caused by \u003ccode\u003epow\u003c/code\u003e. Didn\u0027t expect to it to produce floating point numbers even when fed integers. A lesson learned, I guess. Sometimes I wish for Haskell\u0027s \u003ccode\u003e^\u003c/code\u003e (yes, I know it\u0027s XOR in c++).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new submission: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/525/submission/11008141\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/525/submission/11008141\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["c++","output","compiler","c++11"]}}
