You are given an chocolate bar of size M*N. Also you are given an array of pieces to be cut. Example: If M- 3 and N \u003d 4, the array that is given is : 1,2,3 and 6\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe can divide the chocolate into such rectangular pieces of these sizes. Note that the sizes have to be rectangular.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan we do this just by checking the sum and then see if the following constraints are satisfied:\u003c/p\u003e \u003col\u003e   \u003cli\u003eI am using just a verification that if the size to be cut(K) is odd, then the value of M or N has to be greater than or equal to K, then only we can cut it into (1 X K) or (K X 1).\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eI do not get whether this is an advanced problem or just some ad hoc problem. Please advice on how to solve the question and ask any queries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["adhoc","chocolate"]}}
