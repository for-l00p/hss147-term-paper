Then, I am doing a bottom-up DP, with two states â€” position, no of spells remaining. dp[pos,sp] contains the minimum strength required to kill Rajasi at position \u0026quot;pos\u0026quot; using at most \u0026quot;sp\u0026quot; spells. Finally, if there is a valid configuration for pos\u003d0, the answer is \u0026quot;Y\u0026quot;, else \u0026quot;N\u0026quot;. This approach gives WA on test #2. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease help me figure out if my approach is wrong. Thanks for your help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
