However, because of some special property of the problem, the algorithms complexity is reduced. An example is USACO 2016 February Platinum Fenced In (\u003ca\u003ehttp://usaco.org/index.php?page\u003dviewproblem2\u0026amp;cpid\u003d625)\u003c/a\u003e. The problem involves applying Kruskals algorithm in a clever way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was wondering if someone has more examples of these kinds of problems, specifically ones that use MST or max flow algorithms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
