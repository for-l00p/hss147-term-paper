It is okay if you didn\u0027t understand it or any of the above.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is no need to know any coding beforehand, if you play around with the following codes and create your own programs, everything will become extremely simple.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLearn to enjoy the error messages. Usually the error message will tell you the line number of the error, or give some sort of description on whats wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCoding is very sensitive and the computer is extremely dumb, any sort of spelling error and the computer wont recognize what you are doing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, anyone who found the first lesson too easy, i suggest attending the intermediate course with Maram and then seeing if it is more fit for you, and you are welcome to come back if otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIll be sure to give a break next time an hour into the lesson.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI will see you all in two weeks time inshallah, good luck and have fun! :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.” ― Albert Einstein\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
