I knew before DFS,and I had use it in 10+ problems,so it was a bit easier to undestand BFS. After of much time of reading(editorial) and effort,I undestood the solution of this: \u0026quot;Inviational 02 Semifinal Room 2 — Div 1 500 — Escape\u0026quot;,problem from topcoder,and I solved it. But I saw that in topcoder tutorial,has not other bfs problems. Could you link me one more BFS problem down,that his difficulty is almost same with the above problem?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(I googled it,but in my results,I did not find the level of each problem,so I couldnt know,if I am suitable to solve that.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you for your time, and sorry if my english is a bit meaningless :P !!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
