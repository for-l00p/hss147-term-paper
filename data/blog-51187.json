Problem link here: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.spoj.com/problems/IITWPC4E/\"\u003elink\u003c/a\u003e. Basically it says to find the area of union of rectangles. Number of rectangles is up to 10^5. Is it possible to solve this problem using 2D segment tree + lazy propagation?. I read about quadtrees, but it\u0027s written complexity of per operation in Quadtrees is O(N). Can you give any hint to solve this problem? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
