Then prefix sum that array for range sum queries. After that on the suffix array of t+\u0027#\u0027+Sbegin iterate over the sorted suffixes which have Sbegin as a prefix to find how many times Send occurs after beginning of each one(using the prefix sum thingy) and use lcp for not counting re-occurrences. I am not sure if this works but i have tried to code this and it failed on test case 24. It might have bugs i am new at S.A. coding. \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/113/submission/10309125\" title\u003d\"Submission 10309125 by burakcetin\"\u003e10309125\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs it possible to solve this problem this way or with Suffix Array?
