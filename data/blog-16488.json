Once, I was learning about Eulerian path and algorithm of it\u0027s founding, but did not find then the appropriate problem on online judges. Now I am solving another problem, where finding Eulerian cycle is just a part of task, and I would like to check my skills in realization of the algorithm on some simpler problem. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe question is: can anyone recommend me problems connected with finding Eulerian path?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["graph theory","eulerian path","algomation","online judge"]}}
