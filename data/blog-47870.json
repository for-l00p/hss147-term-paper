Its over, so safe to discuss now. I am interested in strategies approaches for this :) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‘samu’ and ‘vibhu’ are playing a game where there are N integers from 1 to N lying on the table. In each turn, the player gets to pick one integer to mark as visited from among the previously unvisited ones. If in a turn, the player picks a number which completes the picking of three consecutive numbers, he wins. i.e., say at some stage in the game 2 and 4 are already picked(visited) if the player now picks 3, he wins. Assuming samu starts first and both the players play perfectly optimally, who is the winner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["game theory","algorithms"]}}
