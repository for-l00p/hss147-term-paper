I need help on this problem. I\u0027ve tried my code against various outputs, but still the judge shows \u0026quot;Wrong Answer\u0026quot;. Where\u0027s the problem? At first I thought maybe the numbers(suppose n) which can be expressed as m!(m is another number smaller than n), but not as sum of factorials, are giving me WA; but I tried that way too and got WA. It\u0027d be a great help to me if anyone could point out what should be done. Thanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem\u003d1189\"\u003eProblem link\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"http://pastebin.com/cg573hUh\"\u003eMy code\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
