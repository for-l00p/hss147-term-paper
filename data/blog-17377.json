The only problem with that interpretation though is that there is a sudden jump in the velocity at times 1, 2, ..., t-1, so the velocities look like step functions. This would mean that the acceleration at those times is infinite. Did I misinterpret the problem?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["534b","solution","greedy"]}}
