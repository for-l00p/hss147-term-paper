This is going to take time \u003d O(V(E+V)log(V)) which is too large for the given data set.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t understand what does the approach â€” \u0026quot;Instead, randomly select pairs of vertices and evaluate minimum weight path (also referred to as shortest path) between them\u0026quot;, mentioned in the 4th question mean.
