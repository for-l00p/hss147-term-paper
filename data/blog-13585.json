Now I\u0027m a person that loves to know exactly the complexity of his algorithms so I tried to look around the web for the values and I read from wikipedia the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_function\"\u003eDivisor Function\u003c/a\u003e page, but I couldn\u0027t find what I\u0027m looking for (it might\u0027ve been there, I had tough time understanding most of their explanations).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo suppose \u003cstrong\u003eD(n)\u003c/strong\u003e is the number of divisors of \u003cstrong\u003en\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m looking for a good bound on \u003cstrong\u003eD(n)\u003c/strong\u003e expressed using \u003cstrong\u003en\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote that it is very easy to see and prove that \u003cstrong\u003eD(n)\u0026lt;2*sqrt(n)\u003c/strong\u003e, but I did some tests and I believe a stronger (not much stronger but still stronger) bound should exist. Sorry if the answer is already described somewhere online, I had tough time finding it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["complexity","divisors","algebra","bounds","divisor function"]}}
