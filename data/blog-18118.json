And hence began forming the recurrence. Condensing the problem statement you have n blocks, you need to make a tower of height h such that the bottom most level has m blocks and on each level, number of blocks should be one greater or one lesser than the previous level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have n\u003d7,h\u003d3,m\u003d2 then allowed tower is 2-1-2 and 2-3-2. Constraints are n\u0026lt;\u003d32767,h\u0026lt;\u003d60,m\u0026lt;\u003d10.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy recurrence consists of three states such that f(n,h,m) \u003d f(n-m,h-1,m+1) + f(n-m,h-1,m+1), where f(i,j,k) indicates number of ways you can form a tower consisting of n blocks , of height h and no. of top level blocks being m.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wrote a top-down and bottom up approach the complexity being O(N*H*M), after some observation You can reduce N by a huge factor (not relevant to the current discussion, i suppose). I did that too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I still get TLE, I would submit my links. Could someone please help me with this.
