Let\u0027s say if there are \u0027n\u0027 people standing is a circle. Now I will talk to the 1st person, then skip next \u0027a\u0027 people and talk to (a+2)-th person. I am supposed to calculate the number of people I have to talk to, before I can talk to the 1st person again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEg 1: The number of people \u003d 10. The number of people to skip \u003d 3.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eso, the order in which I will go to people is -\u0026gt; 1 5 9 3 7 1 here, we can see that I had to go through 4 people to reach to 1 again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEg 2: The number of people \u003d 10. The number of people to skip \u003d 1\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ethe order to reach out to people -\u0026gt; 1 3 5 7 9 1 here, 4 people were visited before reaching to 1 again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow the naive approach to solving this problem will be to iterate over the array but that will give me a time complexity of O(n) but if the number of people standing in the circle is of the order 10^18. This will not work.I think a better way to approach this problem would be by the help of gcd operation but I am not able to figure out the correct specifics of that approach. Also, Is there a approach to solve these type of questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["cycles","#implementation","gcd"]}}
