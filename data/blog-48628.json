I am not sure why it is wrong...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe basic idea of my code was that I use binary lifting to store the 2^kth ancestor and the distance to the 2^kth ancestor in bparent[][] and bdist[][]. I then binary search for the highest ancestor that each node is controlled by and store the starting and ending points in event[], which i can just dfs and sum up in my function solve(). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCould somebody please tell me where I went wrong in my code? Any help would be appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
