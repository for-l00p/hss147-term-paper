The problems for all levels are from UTP Open 2015 divisions 1 and 2, programming contests of Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira (UTP) in Colombia hosted by the Red de Programación Competitiva (RPC), which took place on 2015 (although were added some problems to each level, from another sources).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe contest duration is 10 days. The tasks are in English. The allowed programming languages are C, C++, C++11, C#, Java, Perl, PHP, Bash, Ruby, Pascal and Python. The contest will be held on the rules for progressive competitions in the COJ. If you have any question, please feel free to ask on \u003ca href\u003d\"mailto:coj@uci.cu\"\u003ecoj@uci.cu\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou need to have an account in the Caribbean Online Judge (COJ — \u003ca\u003ehttp://coj.uci.cu/user/createnewaccount.xhtml)\u003c/a\u003e. You don\u0027t need to register in the contest — the registration in the contest is effective with the first submission.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe challenge is as follows:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003eThe problems are divided by difficulty levels, and in the beginning you only have access to the first level of problems.\nIn order to gain access to the next level of problems, you must solve a specific number of problems from the current level (defined by the Contest-Setter).\nNot all levels require the same amount of problems and, of course, we design each level to be more challenging than the previous one.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbout the ranking of the contest:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003eThere will be not penalty time for rejected submissions.\nThere will be not (less or more) points by solve any problem after or before another user. Points are assigned when you solve a problem.\nEach problem has a fixed number of points, so no matter the number of users who solved it will always worth the same.\nThe gained points are in this form: TPOINTS / (TLEVELS - PLEVEL + 1) where TPOINTS is the Total Points defined for all the problems in the contest, TLEVELS is the Total Levels defined for the contest and PLEVEL is the level of the given problem. Note that problems in the first level gives you TPOINTS / TLEVELS points, and problems on the last level gives you TPOINTS points (full points). The higher the level, the more points are gained.\nIf two users have the same points in the ranking, the user who has solved its problems before, must be in a higher rank.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor this 8th edition of \u0026quot;The COJ Progressive Contest\u0026quot; we have six levels of problems, and you need to solve 4 problems from each one to pass to the next level. On the other hand, you only need to solve 25 problems in the entire contest to see all the problems in all the levels. The value for TPOINTS is 60 points (in this edition).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProblems by levels:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003eLevel 1 : 7 problems.\nLevel 2 : 6 problems.\nLevel 3 : 5 problems.\nLevel 4 : 5 problems.\nLevel 5 : 4 problems.\nLevel 6 : 3 problems.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you get to the last level?
