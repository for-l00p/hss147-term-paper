KUPC has been held every year for about 5 years in Japan, but this is the first time to provide English problem statements. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI participated in the test round of this contest. The first a few problems are easy, so I\u0027m sure everyone can enjoy the contest. On the other hand, a few problems from the last are probably interesting and though enough for high rated coders. We hope lots of people will compete in our contest. Good luck and have fun.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
