(no, codeforces didn\u0027t force me to do anything) but for real, why almost none of the contests are on weekends? I can only compete in contests during the weekend due to school/job,, so my involvement in competitive programming has been reduced drastically (cause I only do Codeforces because it\u0027s the best!). This has always been an issue, but I believe recently it has been worse than ever. Are there other people in a similar situation as me?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUPDATE AUG 6: We did it guys!
