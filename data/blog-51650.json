You are also given N special points (N \u0026lt;\u003d 5000). Each of the N special points has a different power Ri (R \u0026lt;\u003d 10^9) associated with it. Each of these points can influence all points of the grid within a manhattan distance of R (if the manhattan distance between the special point and any other point is \u0026lt;\u003d Ri, it will be influenced). Find out how many points are totally influenced in the grid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI thought about some sort of coordinate compression + Line Sweep algorithm + dp but could not get it through. I also tried converting points into x + y \u0026amp; x â€” y + coordinate compression + BIT but could not get any ideas. Please help. I am so stuck! Thanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEdit: I meant lattice points while referring to points in all cases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["manhattan distance","dp","line sweep"]}}
