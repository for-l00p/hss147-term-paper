For example: on problem 872A ( \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/872/A\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/872/A\u003c/a\u003e ) i submitted my code and i got WA on pretest 3. This looks something like this (first image) . I did not believe that this is wrong. So i ran this code but this showed the right answer (second and third image). SO i made a conclusion that sometimes Codeforces\u0027 testing system is wrong even though our code is true! I hope they will fix this!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst image : \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ibb.co/ghzOT6\"\u003ehttps://ibb.co/ghzOT6\u003c/a\u003e Second image : \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ibb.co/mOV8vm\"\u003ehttps://ibb.co/mOV8vm\u003c/a\u003e Third image : \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ibb.co/keUOT6\"\u003ehttps://ibb.co/keUOT6\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["mikemirzayanov"]}}
