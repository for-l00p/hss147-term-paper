I am getting TLE on testcase 63. Here is my submission \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/398/submission/21266586\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/398/submission/21266586\u003c/a\u003e. According to me, the time complexity of my code is O[q * (S + K)] where q is number of queries and S (S ~ 500) is constant size defined for a node to be heavy and K denotes total number of heavy nodes. A node is heavy if degree[node] \u0026gt; S. Please correct me if I am wrong. Can I do something better? What changes should I make in my code? Any insights would be really helpful. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
