Like me, many contestants are working on week days. It is very hard for me to attend weekdays contests. So, if you consider the problem, please try to arrange contests on weekends (Saturday or Sunday or any middle time between Sat and Sun). Though I am not a good contestant, still I believe this will encourage more people like me!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for all of your patience!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
