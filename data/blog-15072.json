I have seen recently, that most of the Classical problems on Spoj Which used to be on the Pyramid Cluster (733 MHz) have now been migrated to the Cube Cluster (3 GHz). Just wanted to know Is it a good move or not, in your opinion ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoes this up gradation affect the way people approached the Classical Problems on Spoj ? because time limits of some tasks are way too liberal (as far as C++/C are concerned) .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know that time limits would have been carefully calculated so that solutions of inappropriate complexity would not pass, but still will this up gradation let unoptimized solutions pass like the ones with a higher constant factor which earlier used to time out ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOr do you think it\u0027s a move to give breathing space for languages like Python etc.\u003cbr /\u003ePlus wouldn\u0027t that be a bit unfair for the guys who solved those problems like 2-3 years ago and got TLE for the above mentioned reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["spoj"]}}
