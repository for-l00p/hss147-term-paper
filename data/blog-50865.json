There are two strings \u003cstrong\u003eS1,S2\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003e|S1|,|S2\u003c/strong\u003e|\u0026lt;\u003d5000. Let \u003cstrong\u003en\u003c/strong\u003e is the max length of two strings. Is there a \u003cstrong\u003eO(n^2)\u003c/strong\u003esolution which can find S2\u0027s all subtrings\u0027s longest common sequence with S1 ?
