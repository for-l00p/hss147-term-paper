The problem is as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is a string \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eS\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e that consists of lowercase English alphabets, Two players â€” \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eB\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e are playing a game. In one turn, a player can choose either the character at the leftmost end or the character at the rightmost end. Suppose the player chose a character \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eC\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, then all \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eC\u003c/i\u003e\u0027\u003ci\u003es\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e are removed from the string. Player A plays first. The player who removes the last characters of the string wins, i.e. if on removal of a certain character the string becomes empty, then the player who removed those letters wins. If both players play optimally, find out the player who wins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEDIT\u003c/b\u003e: When the characters are removed, the player gets as many points as the number of characters that are removed. If both players play optimally, find the winner. (Both players try to maximize the points scored)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["game theory"]}}
