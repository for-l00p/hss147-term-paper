From the comments in that thread, it helps cut the speed by a factor of approximately 1/4, but is it really true?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI personally am not familiar with these things, but if they will really cut the speed of a program, that would be something curious to look into (maybe fit the TL with O(N^2) for N\u003d1e5 ;)) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow you think, just get better, who needs these magic tricks, they\u0027re not even fair :P. But there are always some cases where I have some program, and it\u0027s barely over TL, and microoptimizations like these would (maybe?) bring it down to the TL. There\u0027s been some case where I\u0027ve changed all the ints to shorts just to fit the TL... xD\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo just for fun, if anyone can provide some light on SSE instructions (do they really help?), that would be pretty cool!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eminimario\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["sse","magic","optimizations"]}}
