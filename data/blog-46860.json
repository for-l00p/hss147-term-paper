The choice fell on the compiler MinGW-w64, version of GCC 6.2.0 (will be updated on new releases). If you have Windows, you can easlily install it using \u003ca href\u003d\"http://pbox.me\"\u003ePBOX\u003c/a\u003e with one command \u003ccode\u003epbox install mingw-w64\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBesides trendy features of C++14 (not sure there\u0027s a lot to the contests), there are some advantages:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003ethis compiler is faster than mingw-tdm 5.1.0 on cin/cout — for example, reverse a sequence of \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e10\u003csup class\u003d\"upper-index\"\u003e6\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/span\u003e integers from 1 to \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e10\u003csup class\u003d\"upper-index\"\u003e6\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/span\u003e runs 1.5 seconds instead of 2.5 (0.3 vs. 1 if you use \u003ccode\u003estd :: ios :: sync_with_stdio (false)\u003c/code\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eworks correctly to print a double with the both specifiers %f and %lf (you should read using %lf)\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eworks correctly to read-write long double with the specifier %Lf\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eworks correctly to read-write long long both with %lld and %I64d\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt seems that lately we remove support of MinGW C++/C++11 (especially since it is difficult to upgrade them to GCC 6 due to backward compatibility issues).
