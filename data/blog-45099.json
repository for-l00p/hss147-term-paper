I guess if you fix K it will become a regular expression but the length will grow too fast as K grows and since matching it requires 2^(len of expression) preprocessing I don\u0027t see a realistic way of doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow did they manage to use regular expressions to solve the problem??? \u003ca href\u003d\"https://online.acmicpc.org/problems/string\"\u003eproblem link\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dsLdzLvAqXxg\"\u003esolution video\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["icpc","regular expressions"]}}
