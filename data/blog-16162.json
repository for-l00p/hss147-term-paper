I just want a second on review on my \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/WvvB6n\"\u003ecode\u003c/a\u003e to try to figure out what is happening here. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI see each island of the problem (cartesian point with integers coordinates) as an edge between x and y. Then if a build several path alternating colors it guarantees that each island will have a couple on the same row (column) with another color. Of course, each path start on a node with odd degree unless there aren\u0027t, so then, i am looking for cycles. If this approach is wrong i need some suggestion, but if it isn\u0027t, i just want to know why this answer is getting SIGSEGV.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["euler tour","sigsegv","spoj"]}}
