Problems are set by coders who are also humans like rest of us, so it\u0027s natural to occur some errors even if they are tested carefully. What I observed after that incident is , the frequency of contests has been reduced.Without much contests codeforces looks deserted these days. Hence , I appeal to the CF community (specially high rated coders ) to continue the trend and bring some more contest for us. Codeforces has always been known for it\u0027s fabulous frequent rounds and it will always be so. In the end, I want to say \u003cstrong\u003ethanks\u003c/strong\u003e to all the problem setters out there â€” trust me you do a great job. Thank you . Wish you a good day ahead. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["cotests","rounds"]}}
