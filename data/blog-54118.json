I am unable to view the website as usual for 2 hours now . This problem is faced not only by me but by some other friends of mine . I am including the screenshots of my screen . Also to make sure that it is not a local problem on my system I have attached other sites screenshots too . Please resolve this matter as soon as possible . Thanks in advance :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy problem is still not resolved I am unable to participate in contests in Codeforces due to shrinkage in the view UI of Codeforces for me and in my local area too . Please fix this issue ;) I am attaching a screenshot of my screen of Codeforces (I hope the screenshot is uploaded cause it\u0027s not shown in my local system ) . IF such problems keep continuing i guess I should move to some other OJ :( ![ ](\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/a711fd/Screenshot\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/a711fd/Screenshot\u003c/a\u003e from 2017-08-31 12-49-28.png)\u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/a3/7e/a37e638f4a8dd61b822deaaed741bc9d8568f4dc.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/7c/2b/7c2b5acaa5b90403228e209af5353a75dab82448.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#codeforces","bug"]}}
