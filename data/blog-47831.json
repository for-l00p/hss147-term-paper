For now we consider each character in the picture is a N*M matrix with only zeros and ones, and we need to recognize K characters. You are to write a program to find minimal number of pixels so that we can recognize each character. The first line of input is three integers N, M, K (1 \u0026lt;\u003d N, M \u0026lt;\u003d 10, 2 \u0026lt;\u003d K \u0026lt;\u003d 6). Which represents the size of matrix and number of characters. Then is following K blocks, which represents the matrix. Notice that each block starts with a blank line. K is number of character matrices You should output the minimum number of pixels, which is the answer Input 2 3 2 111 010 100 100 output 1\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
