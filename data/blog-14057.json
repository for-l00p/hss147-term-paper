Sorry for mixing up with TopCoder!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy understanding of \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/472/problem/D\"\u003ethe problem\u003c/a\u003e as below: A matrix is given where each entry (row,col) represents weight of an edge from row to col. We have to check if the matrix can be represented as a weighted tree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, I think, there are two things to check. If a node has a positive edge (weight\u0026gt;0) to itself, then it is not a weighted tree. If weight[u,v] !\u003d weight[v,u], then it is also not a weighted tree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAre these conditions sufficient? I think NO. But, I am not getting what else should we check. I googled about \u0026quot;weighted tree\u0026quot; to gain some knowledge. I found that it is a tree simply weights are given for every edge. Am I missing something? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf anyone can clarify the problem description and the missing parts of my knowledge about weighted tree, I will be grateful!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["codeforces round -270","weighted tree"]}}
