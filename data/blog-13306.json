In other places it is 0. Value of d is 107.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe optimal solution is: take 1, 2 and 100. But if I follow the solution at analysis, it will be 100 if we go left first and 53 if we go right first. The reason is, in the optimal solution we spend 4 days right side (move right + attraction). But if f() is computed independent of the fact that we will move left later then f(4) \u003d s+3 and we gain 50 but the optimal solution will say don\u0027t go that far to s+3 rather you collect 1 and 2 in 4 days and move left. So it is not true that f(t) be always the optimal point if we had the reduced problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan any one explain where I am going wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["ioi 2014"]}}
