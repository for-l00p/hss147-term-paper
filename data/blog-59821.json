We are trying to reward users\u0027 math skills with high ratings as there are not many sites that do this yet. We also try our best to set up the problems in such a way that any trivial brute force approach isn\u0027t supposed to work (for the mediocre/difficult problems).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTime-penalty\u003c/strong\u003e is applicable for the contest: Each problem is given an appropriate number of points, which will be visible when the round starts. Participants will gain \u003cstrong\u003ethat many points — the time penalty\u003c/strong\u003e after successfully submitting to a particular problem. The later the problem submission occurs, the more points being deducted due to time penalty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe round is \u003cstrong\u003erated\u003c/strong\u003e; which means that if you participate in the contest, your rating will be updated at the end of the round based on your rank in it.
