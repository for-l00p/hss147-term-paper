Each cell is either empty or has a firework. Empty cells are marked with \u0026quot;.\u0026quot;, cells with firework are marked with \u0026quot;\u0026quot; . Two cells are said to be adjacent if they share a side.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf firework in any cell explodes it destroys itself and the empty cells connected to it. Two cells are connected if there is a path of empty adjacent cells between them. You have to find the number of cells that will be destroyed if the fireworks are triggered independently.
