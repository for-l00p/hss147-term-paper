This was while I was using Java 7.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust thought I\u0027d give it a shot and submitted the \u003cstrong\u003editto same\u003c/strong\u003e code but in Java 8. Works like a charm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/424/submission/6538622\"\u003eJava 7 submission\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/424/submission/6538768\"\u003eJava 8 submission\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0027s not some minor difference. There\u0027s a running time difference of \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026gt; 2s\u003c/strong\u003e, with Java 8 being the faster one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m really curious as to why this happens. Yes, I know some kind of optimization is happening but what kind? A 2s difference is a \u003cstrong\u003eLOT\u003c/strong\u003e so it is non-trivial. Somebody explain? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["java 7","java 8","time limit"]}}
