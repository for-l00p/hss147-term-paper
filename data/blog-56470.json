I used library function \u0027strstr\u0027 to compare the two inputs. By bruteforce, the answer must be \u0027yes\u0027 if their exists a substring like that otherwise a no. But it gives yes for all. can anyone tell me where is the error? I know the solution using the array. but i wanted to try this one out. Thanks in advance.
