In the problem you are given a NxM table (N*M\u0026lt;\u003d1000) — the initial configuration of the game. You whant to make all the cells equal to zero. You should print a way to do this. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem can be solved with meet in the middle and bitmask dp, with the given constraints. Another way is using Gauss elimination modulo 2 with N*M equations for each cell. But this approach is \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eO\u003c/i\u003e((\u003ci\u003eN\u003c/i\u003e * \u003ci\u003eM\u003c/i\u003e)\u003csup class\u003d\"upper-index\"\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e.
