Some abstractions might be difficult to understand when they are just written down, instead of someone explaining to you in front of you on a board or paper. If you are school or college student, best way is to look around you, you\u0027ll find plenty of people doing these contests and willing to discuss and share their knowledge with you. If there aren\u0027t any such people, you can form a programming club in your institution and inspire other people too to join you. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGood luck!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFoot note: All gifs made using \u003ca href\u003d\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id\u003dcom.nekki.vector\u0026amp;hl\u003den\"\u003eVector â€” Android Apps on Google Play\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["science","contest","collaboration","tagsareboring"]}}
