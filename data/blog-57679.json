Therefore, 5 % 3 should give 2. But what if a is negative, in that case, the answer is multiplied by a negative sign. i.e. -5 % 3 gives -2 as answer. But what is actually is required is a positive answer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHence, correctly the mod function can be written as (b + (a % b)) % b.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#number theory"]}}
