Each query consists of a single integer X, and you\u0027re asked to determine if there\u0027s a pair of integers in the array whose sum is X, or if there isn\u0027t any.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t determine any limits, but the less, the better. some bounds can be on the maximal value of an element in the array, I don\u0027t mind, as long as someone finds a solution better than mentioned earlier. Would also be better if the algorithms will be able to output the indicies of the 2 integers with sum X.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d also be happy if someone proves it to be impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["arrays","queries"]}}
