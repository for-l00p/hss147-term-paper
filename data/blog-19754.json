However, I have gone through the USACO training pages to learn my algorithms, which doesn\u0027t have a section on topological sorting. I know standard graph algorithms like bfs,dfs,warshall,dijkstra, etc. but I don\u0027t know how to solve these topological sorting problems. The editorial mentions that this is a classic topological sort problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy question is, how can dfs be applied to solve this problem, and where can I find more theory/practice problems to practice topological sorting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["graph","topological sort"]}}
