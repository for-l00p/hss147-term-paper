You are given array a of size N and you need partition the array in K sub-arrays such that the difference between the sum of the elements in maximum sub-array and sum of the elements in minimum sub-array should be minimum. Partitions can be cyclic for example : a[N -2], a[N â€” 1], a[0] ,a[1] can form a sub-array.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet me know guys if you need more clarifications.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#dp","partition"]}}
