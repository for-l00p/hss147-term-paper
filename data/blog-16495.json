The team has qualified for World Finals every year since 2004 except for 2011. Ironically, that was the year the contest was held in Orlando! Joining me as a camp instructor is Matt Fontaine, an ACM ICPC World Finalist for UCF from 2012. Matt has written rounds for TopCoder, questions for the South East Regional Programming Competition and the North American Invitational Programming Contest. In addition, other UCF team members and coaches will support the camp as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe hope that some of you will join us for our inaugural camp!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eArup Guha\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["training camp","high school","united states"]}}
