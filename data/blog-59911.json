Do you know any available configurations for the listings package so that it will looks great like in CLion or VSCode? Thank you. Hello everyone,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am looking for some software that can (ideally) process the C++ source files and automatically generate me a notebook with syntax highlighting and numbering. Do you know any?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf automation is not possible, doing it by hand is fine, but I cannot seem to find any tool that allows both good syntax highlighting and line numbering. At the moment, I am using Visual Studio Code and Word and the line numbering takes a lot of time. It would be great if some automation tools exist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you very much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
