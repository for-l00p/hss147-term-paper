But sadly when I looked 1 hour ago on rating update,I saw that my rating was lower,and it says that I took place 500+ as you can see on my profile. Here is my proof : \u003ca href\u003d\"http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic\u003d3538l8k\u0026amp;s\u003d8\"\u003ehttp://tinypic.com/view.php?pic\u003d3538l8k\u0026amp;s\u003d8\u003c/a\u003e , or you can look on standings page 3 (places ranging from 200 to 299). I want to know if anyone has ever had this problem and if this can be solved... Thank you :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["rating","confussion"]}}
