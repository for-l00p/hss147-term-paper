Around 180 people have done this. I don\u0027t know if its an easy problem or a very difficult problem. There\u0027s not much editorial available online. The problem asks to find the no. of distinct common subsequences b/w four given strings. ex:  aaaa ,aaaa , aaaa ,aaaa No. of distinct common subsequences b/w them are 4. i.e, a, aa, aaa , aaaa let the strings be s1,s2,s3,s4. let T(w,x,y,z) calculate the no. of distinct subsequences b/w s1[1..w] , s2[1..x] , s3[1..y] , s4[1..z] what will be the recurence relation when s1[w] \u003d\u003d s2[x] \u003d\u003d s3[y] \u003d\u003d s4[z] (its not 1 + 2*T(w — 1,x — 1,y — 1,z — 1) coz in the above example T(3,3,3,3) \u003d 3 , T(4,4,4,4) \u003d 4 !\u003d 1 + 2*3) and otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlz help!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dynamic programming","spoj problem"]}}
