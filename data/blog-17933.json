Also, it uses trie and i have never written trie before.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e Does anyone have any idea to solve this problem using suffix automata? Or if it\u0027s impossible with suffix automata can anyone share their ideas about this problem ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["usaco","gold","solution","help"]}}
