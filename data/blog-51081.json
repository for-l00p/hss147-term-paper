For the input 12 how output is 5 ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy solution is :\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eat time 0 we jump from 0 to 1 co-ordinate\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eat time 1 we jump from 1 to 3 co-ordinate\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eat time 2 we jump from 3 to 6 co-ordinate\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eat time 3 we dont jump because now jump length will be 4 , since we are on co-ordinate 6 so if we jump we will be on 6+4\u003d10 co-ordinate ,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eat time 4 we dont jump because now jump length will be 5 , since we are on co-ordinate 6 so if we jump we will be on 6+5\u003d10 co-ordinate ,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eat time 5 we will jump because now jump length will be 6 , since we are on co-ordinate 6 so if we jump we will be on 6+6\u003d12 co-ordinate . We reached on co-ordinate 12 at time 6 . because one jump takes one second (5+1\u003d6) .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo ans should be 6 . Why 5 ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
