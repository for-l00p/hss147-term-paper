Moreover, Codeforces supports Scala, which also runs on JVM, it\u0027s a much more expressive language with more advanced features, although they are useless for the competitive programming context: thus is makes more sense to add Kotlin (also|instead).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would like to know what people think about it, and if I can contribute anyhow to make it possible, I would like to know as well.
