Can I make a variable which is int type, but when it overflow, it convert to long long type. For example I make an integer variable x. I give max integer value on x. When I add 1 to x, I do not want to overflow. I want to make ( auto convert to) long long and continue with next number. Is it possible? I am sorry if I ask a stupid question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["c++","data types"]}}
