For instance, right after you participate in CodeForces round tomorrow, you can use this page to go over the problems. Perhaps, once you finish TopCoder SRM on Saturday, you can do that also; I will initiate the discussion on the Saturday SRM.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are many contests coming up this month and the next (Facebook Hacker Cup Round 2, USACO, CodeChef Long Contest, etc.); you may use this blog to freely discuss issues you had, problems you liked, and etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce a major contest happens, one of us can create a blog page with the title of the contest on it (just like what I did for Facebook Hacker Cup Round 1) so that you can share your performance/thought as well as open up a discussion for improvement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am hoping this group blog would become quite interactive as time passes :) It is known that once you start writing about algorithms and things that you should work on next, such an action alone helps you on reinforcing the learning experience. Let\u0027s try this ourselves!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-blue\" href\u003d\"/profile/yongwhan\" title\u003d\"Expert yongwhan\"\u003eyongwhan\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
