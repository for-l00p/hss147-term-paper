As UVA 10688- The Poor Giant can be solve in a similar way to Cutting Sticks and obviously the condition dp[a][b-1]\u0026lt;\u003ddp[a][b]\u0026lt;\u003ddp[a+1][b] holds , can somebody tell me a way to manipulate the knuth-yao basic code to give right answer to this problem? :) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course a little explanation about the main Knuth-Yao code will also help a lot , thanks !!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dp","optimization","question","problem","uva 10688"]}}
