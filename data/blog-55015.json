In this very first blog of mine I am curious to know about plagiarism detector algorithm that Hackerrank use. The reason being that yesterday i looked up to a contest on hackerrank which had a very nice set of problems which apparently i couldn\u0027t solve as i am new to competitive programming so i decided to look up the editorials and solutions of other top participants on leaderboard. During this process i found out many codes almost similar (examples are attached below in the link). I was startled by seeing this plagiarism of code and would like to know whether hackerrank will be able to detect this or not? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eContest link — \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.hackerrank.com/visa-codeurway-2017\"\u003ehttps://www.hackerrank.com/visa-codeurway-2017\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuestion link — \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/visa-codeurway-2017/challenges/chang-dilemma\"\u003ehttps://www.hackerrank.com/contests/visa-codeurway-2017/challenges/chang-dilemma\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolution link 1 — \u003ca href\u003d\"https://pastebin.com/6WsPmn2e\"\u003ehttps://pastebin.com/6WsPmn2e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolution link 2 — \u003ca href\u003d\"https://pastebin.com/ZKMuU811\"\u003ehttps://pastebin.com/ZKMuU811\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs it is clearly visible that there is slight changes in comment and naming of few variables so how does hackerrank tackle this problem of plagiarism in such important contests?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNew coder :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
