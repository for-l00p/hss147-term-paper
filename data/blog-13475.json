Otherwise, try to think-prove problems sometimes take too much time, and sometime u cant do it.But if u can do it, u will remember it long. So in ur opinion, which should we do more? I am on my way practicing. I hope u guys will give me some advice so that i can improve myself. Sorry for my mistakes in the writing(i will try more) Thank u!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
