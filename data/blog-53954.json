DP table can be dp[900][200000] so that is MLE. But there is an observation that level i depends only on level i-1 so dp[2][200000] is sufficient. My question is how to implement this in top down approach with memoization. Is it possible in such questions to write a top down approach or we have to go with bottom up. Thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dynamic programming"]}}
