By the way, it happened not because the VK company lost the interest towards Codeforces and programming contests. Not at all. On the countrary, we have great plans to carry out together! We are infinitely grateful to the VK company for the 4 years of help and support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are glad to inform you that now a wonderful company called Telegram is going to help Codeforces. The company is founded by Pavel Durov and it united many brilliant developers with a rich olympic past. It is pleasant and important for us to see Codeforces helped by the people who understand programming contests, love them and value the skills of the community members. The Codeforces team is happy to get the opportunity to continue working and promises to continue dazzling you with contests, innovations and improvements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMike Mirzayanov and the Codeforces team\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["codeforces","telegram"]}}
