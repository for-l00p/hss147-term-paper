Thus I have written some blogs on my own stating my own understanding of the topic, so that it is closely linked to the original blog, yet so that its a bit easier to understand. I have explained some of the key concepts that I feel were only touched upon in the original blog but was actually important. However, whatever I have written is based on the original article. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis only includes the explanations for the general concept and the proofs of task 1 and task 2 only. However I hope this explains the proof method itself in a better fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have also tried to prove the first task using the method in task 2. However I dont yet know whether it is actually correct, and if someone points out the flaw then I would remove it from my post. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, any improvements can be suggested in the comments and I would try to update them as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://codingwithrajarshi.blogspot.in/2018/03/segment-tree-beats-introduction.html\"\u003econcept\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"http://codingwithrajarshi.blogspot.in/2018/03/segment-tree-beats-complexity.html\"\u003etask 1\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"http://codingwithrajarshi.blogspot.in/2018/03/segment-tree-beats-complexity-continued.html\"\u003etask 2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["segment tree","explanation","datastructure"]}}
