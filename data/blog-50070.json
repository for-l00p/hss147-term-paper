I can\u0027t think of any approach for this problem. Firstly I thought, lets iterate through 0 to n .. and see if I delete i character from string will I get S \u003d T + T ..but after some time I realised it\u0027s difficult to keep track which characters to be deleted and so on.. Recently in Educational Round at Codeforces I got another \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/762/problem/C\"\u003eproblem\u003c/a\u003e.. I keep getting these types of problems all the time but never solved them . How do I develope an approach for all these types of problems and problems where they delete, insert and do all kind of operations like this \u003ca href\u003d\"https://community.topcoder.com/stat?c\u003dproblem_statement\u0026amp;pm\u003d14391\"\u003eproblem.\u003c/a\u003e. Also I could not find editorials for that match.. if you find please share the link ..\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
