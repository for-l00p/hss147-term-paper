Is there a way to specify (through testsets or whatever) which tests get run on solutions during contests? I noticed that at the end of even a mashup contest there\u0027s something that says \u0026quot;System testing 100%.\u0026quot; Is there a way to make something happen during that time, or is that currently not implemented?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for any suggestions, answers, or alternative solutions you have to offer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["polygon"]}}
