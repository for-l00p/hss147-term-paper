Elly and Kriss are playing a game on a table with size NxM (1\u0026lt;\u003dN,M\u0026lt;\u003d10^9). The player to take a move chooses a cell from the table (R,C) and removes row R and column C and this way she splits the board in 4 parts of sizes (R-1)x(C-1), (R-1)x(M-C), (N-R)x(C-1), (N-R)x(M-C). The one who can\u0027t make a move loses. We are to find out who the winner will be. The idea was to use SG numbers in order to find some pattern which has complexity O(N^2*M^2) and it turned out that the only boards for which the first player loses had sizes 2x2, 4x4, 4x6, 8x12 and 10x10. However, we (also \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-orange\" href\u003d\"/profile/espr1t\" title\u003d\"Master espr1t\"\u003eespr1t\u003c/a\u003e himself) can\u0027t prove that this works for every board, we have only checked that for N and M up to 2000. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease, help us :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["game theory","help","proof"]}}
