The problems for all levels are from multiple programming contests hosted by Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira (UTP) in Colombia, which took place on 2014 (although were added some problems to levels, from several sources).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe contest duration is 7 days. The tasks are in English. The allowed programming languages are C, C++, C#, Java, Perl, PHP, Bash, Ruby, Pascal and Python. The contest will be held on the rules for progressive competitions in the COJ.

In order to gain access to the next level of problems, you must solve a specific number of problems from the current level (defined by the Contest-Setter). Not all levels require the same amount of problems and, of course, we design each level to be more challenging than the previous one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbout the ranking of the contest:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003eThere will be not penalty time for rejected submissions.\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eThere will be not (less or more) points by solve any problem after or before another user.

Note that problems in the first level gives you \u003cstrong\u003eTPOINTS / TLEVELS\u003c/strong\u003e points, and problems on the last level gives you \u003cstrong\u003eTPOINTS\u003c/strong\u003e points (full points).
