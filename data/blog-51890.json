In those SRMs even the people who get 0 will have their rating increase if their rating lies in between 1200-1300. Also they are very difficult compared to usual questions (i mean i saw some red guys in room who just leave/give incorrect submission to that and solve the div 1 medium) that it requires some small out of box trick which is very hard to come up with.They are enjoyable in solving but it actually is no good when \u0026lt;50% people could solve that question in contest.ex:SRM 713, SRM 710, SRM 697,SRM 696(two such consecutive contests can cause devastation of rating and confidence) etc.I can actually show some recent div 1 level 2 problems which are easier to solve than those.Those questions are very good but from contest sense it is no good to see \u0026gt;50% of people in div 1 getting a score of 0.Is there any reason to actually prefer such questions.I have personally seen many coder\u0027s rating dropping from 2100 to 1500-1600 post SRM 680.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["topcoder"]}}
