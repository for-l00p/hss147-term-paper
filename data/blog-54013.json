(1) Compute the average of the points in set A and find all the points with the maximum distance from the average point to the respective points of B.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(2) Then, the average of the points in B is calculated and same way to (1)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(3) (1), (2) Finds the maximum by comparing all the points obtained from.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere seems to be a problem with accuracy. Please let me know if there is an improvement or another way. Thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
