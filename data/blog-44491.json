He also calls a composite number beautiful, if it is divisible by at least one prime number in his chosen set of beautiful primes. Given Rasyakâ€™s set of M beautiful primes and an integer N, you have to find the number of beautiful numbers (both primes and composites) between 1 and N. For example, given a set of 2 beautiful primes, {2, 5}, there are 6 beautiful numbers between 1 and 10 (i.e. 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10). Input The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T (1 \u0026lt;\u003d T \u0026lt;\u003d 100). T test cases follow. Each will consist of one line containing a single integer M, followed by a line containing M space-separated prime numbers mi, followed by another line containing a single integer N. 1 \u0026lt;\u003d M \u0026lt;\u003d 25 1 \u0026lt;\u003d mi \u0026lt;\u003d 1000 1 \u0026lt;\u003d N \u0026lt;\u003d 2*10^9 Output For each test case, output one line containing a single integer X, where X is the number of beautiful numbers between 1 and N.
