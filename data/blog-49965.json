I am new to codeforces and this was my first problem. I was trying powerful arrays \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/86/D\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/86/D\u003c/a\u003e problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI used MO\u0027s algorithm to solve it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy first approach was this **\u003ca\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/86/submission/24070204**\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut this got TLE on test case 43. Now when I made a different function checkAns(); in my next submission \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/86/submission/24070298\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/86/submission/24070298\u003c/a\u003e , it got AC..\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll I changed was I put \u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003eL\u003dqueries[i].L;\n    R\u003dqueries[i].R;\n\n    while(currentL\u0026lt;L){\n       del(currentL);\n       currentL++;\n    };\n    while(currentL\u0026gt;L){\n       add(currentL-1);\n       currentL--;\n    };\n\n    while(currentR\u0026lt;R){\n       add(currentR+1);\n       currentR++;\n    };\n    while(currentR\u0026gt;R){\n       del(currentR);\n       currentR--;\n    };\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003ethis part of my code in a separate function checkAns(i); I am not getting how this got AC if earlier one was getting TLE. Also isn\u0027t function call increases time taken?? Please mention if there is something different on codeforces\u0027 platform.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance :) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEDIT:: I submitted different forms of my code for around 20 times in this question. What I saw is that time taken in this question changes abruptly even on subtle changes in code.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example I changed ll to int in \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/86/submission/21756475\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/86/submission/21756475\u003c/a\u003e code for some arrays and numbers except answer and ans[N] \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/86/submission/24079499\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/86/submission/24079499\u003c/a\u003e and it got AC. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I was doing it, I removed #include \u0026lt;bits/stdc++.h\u0026gt; from my code and time reduced to 2240 from 3630 ms. I think it takes pretty neat and to the point code at Codeforces otherwise these things shouldn\u0027t matter. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
