So, for the case where n \u003d 6, it should be like f(6) \u003d f(2) * f(3), f(2) \u003d (1 + 2) + (2 + 2) \u003d 7, f(3) \u003d (1 + 3) + (3 + 3) \u003d 10, therefore f(6) \u003d f(2) * f(3) \u003d 7 * 10 \u003d 70. But this is the wrong answer. Someone please help me out to figure out the right solution. Any help is really appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["lcm","number theory"]}}
