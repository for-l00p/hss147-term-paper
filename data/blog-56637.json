Since then such a numeration is traditionally used for contests, consisting of very hard problems only.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eContest will be running on Yandex.Contest system. \u003ca href\u003d\"https://contest.yandex.com/newyear2018/contest/7006/enter/\"\u003eLink for registration and participation\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth contests have English statements.
