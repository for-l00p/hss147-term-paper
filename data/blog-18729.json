On Codeforces the author of a particular round also provides an editorial. However, on Topcoder there seems to be a separate set of people who write all the editorials, which can easily cause a backlog. If that is the case may I suggest switching over to the Codeforces model of having a rounds author also write the editorials for that particular round. But all this is just me guessing stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day I would really like to see the editorials for the recent rounds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["topcoder","editorial"]}}
