I relised that dynamics include a huge amount of techniques and approaches, I know some of them, but I\u0027m not good at dinamycs with bits/masks for example. I don\u0027t know also many things in combinatorics like \u0026quot;the number of sequences such that their sum is t\u0026quot; which is 2^(t-1), not really this, but combinatorics like this. So I\u0027m asking you for help. Can you give me please some useful links or name of methods? I would be greatful. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dynamic programming","combinatorics"]}}
