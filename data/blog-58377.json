As per the editorial I have found all the strong connected components and then have found the minimum cost for each SCC component. Also I have found the number of junctions having the minimum value. But I am getting wrong answer for test case 71. My solution is \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/427/submission/36300357\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.
