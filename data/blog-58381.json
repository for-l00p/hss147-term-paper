I\u0027m interested in BOI 2018 and looked into \u003ca href\u003d\"https://boi2018.progolymp.se/\"\u003etheir site\u003c/a\u003e for information. As my country is not a Baltic country, I want to know if some countries can participate unofficially. Seems there is no any contact information on the link. Can one help us to get contact with BOI 2018 organizers? I already wrote to BOI 2017 organizer and got a reply that he is no longer organizer of the contest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["baltic boi","contact","2018 contests"]}}
