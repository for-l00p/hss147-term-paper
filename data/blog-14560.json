I am learning algorithm. I think for a contest programmer there must be a proper order to learn!! May I know the order of learning algorithm for getting next topics easy and for a better performance in contest??(I mean, which should be first,second...etc..? among number theory,data structure, dp, counting ,graph etc.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor me, I know many of graph algorithms.But I didn\u0027t learn segment tree at all :( So, I think its not a proper way. I could never solved a graph problem in contest. I could spent this time in data structure/dp and my basic could be stronger and i could got a good rating in cf contests??? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
