I was thinking about stuffs which would be useful for Codeforces community. My idea is to create Codeforces forum.This would be the place where we write about competitions,solutions,giving each other advice , maybe write about things irrelevant for programming(I love basketball for exapmle ,certainly many programmers love some sport, music ...) Must to see that my English no so good :D , I will have an opportunity to improve it in conversation with other people. Also in my opinion it\u0027s easier then digging through millions of blogs. I\u0027d love to hear your\u0027s view and find out whether this idea feasible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["codeforces","new","forum"]}}
