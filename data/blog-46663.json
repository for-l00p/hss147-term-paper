Personally I receive them every time, and considering pending time... In other words it almost impossible to hack someone with generator (for me, do you have any tricks?) My offer, is for problem-setters provide another program for each problem (excuse me, I know you already have written no less then 4 and also statements...), something between checker and generator â€” it will read like checker and output like generator. And simply redirect user\u0027s generator output to input of this program and output to validator and hacked program.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother solution is smth like topcoder style: authors provides output function and user has to fill it\u0027s parameters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the above mentioned problem is not just nightmare of mine and there are other users who suffers as well, what do you think?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["cf","codeforces","hack","improvments"]}}
