I have been participating in the 2017/2018 COCI contests. But after they are over i like to solve the problems i didn\u0027t solve after the contest. Is there an Online Judge where i can submit these year COCI problems? Or do i need to do it manually with the test cases ( this would be difficult in the problems in which the output is not always the same )\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["coci","online judge locator"]}}
