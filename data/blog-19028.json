Then from the last point of the \u0027clockwise-sorted\u0027 array, I go clockwise and counter-clockwise to calculate two angles: \u003ccode\u003eAngle1\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eAngle2\u003c/code\u003e. These two values are actually the summation of the angle between two consecutive points. I output the minimum one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEventually, I found out that this problem can be solved in a lot shorter way but I cannot find a bug in my approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWas my approach correct?
