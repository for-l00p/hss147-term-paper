If there are no answers, output a “-” in a single line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConstraints:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eN ≥ 1, M ≥ 0, and 1 ≤ N + M ≤ 15.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe sum of the lengths of all strings in one test case does not exceed 320.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomehow, I think this is related to Aho-Corasick but can\u0027t exactly figure out how. Need some direction here. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
