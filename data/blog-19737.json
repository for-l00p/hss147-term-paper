I was solving this problem, \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/52/problem/C\" title\u003d\"Codeforces Testing Round 1\"\u003e52C - Circular RMQ\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is a simple Range Minimum Query problem with range updates (Negative numbers are also present). And I submitted two solutions , One which doesn\u0027t involve Lazy Propagation and the other one which does. The first one got WA and the second one Ac\u0027ed. I am curious. Have a look at the implementations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithout Lazy Propagation — \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/52/submission/12476539\" title\u003d\"Submission 12476539 by sidchelseafan\"\u003e12476539\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Lazy Propagation — \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/52/submission/12477535\" title\u003d\"Submission 12477535 by sidchelseafan\"\u003e12477535\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIsn\u0027t lazy propagation just a technique to do Range Updates Faster ? I had tried my first implementation on many Segment Tree based problems before and it had AC\u0027ed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe TL for this problem is 3s and its very liberal and hence I decided to code a normal Seg Tree without lazy propagation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://se7so.blogspot.in/2012/12/segment-trees-and-lazy-propagation.html\"\u003eLink from where I got my Seg Tree\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t both of them do Range updates in the same time O(log(n)) ?
