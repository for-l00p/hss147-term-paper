However, only some of them are memorable. Each of those problems became a vertebrae in the whole backbone which you lean on to solve other problems e.g. When I encountered \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.spoj.com/problems/MKTHNUM/\"\u003ethis problem\u003c/a\u003e on spoj, I learned the idea about how to apply persistent segment tree and binary search on find k-smallest number \u003d\u0026gt; it helps me a lot, for example, in solving the problem E in Regional acm icpc 2016 in Bangkok.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause there are tons of problems on codeforces and core problems are not that plenty, I want to create a blog that sum up as many core problems as possible to help learners, from juniors to seniors, to shorten the time spending on finding good problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, please comment some problems that, in your perspective, are core problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you!!! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/4b/8c/4b8c33103b5585e347ad27e329bd09f9e6aa7290.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["core problems","learn"]}}
