My main idea is not that special, try every number for P and generate all possible q and stop if you enter in the circle with map, so that idea is O(N^2) and that is not good. Can anyone help me and say some suggestion for that problem.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/gym/100705/problem/A2\"\u003eTask link\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["codefoces","c++"]}}
