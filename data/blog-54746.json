Then for a given k, we can check whether there exist a solution: the i-th (indexed from 0) smallest strength needs to be at least i/k. So we can do binary search (or just enumerate, since n is only 100) on k.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoubt: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy does the ith index need to be atleast i /k ? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
