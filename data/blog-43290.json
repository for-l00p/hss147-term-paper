Sometimes, when I can\u0027t prove the correctness of the approach of the editorial(because the editorial says \u0026quot;the proof is obvious\u0026quot;, and skips the proof entirely), and there aren\u0027t any proofs in comments section too. I can\u0027t decide how much time should be spent thinking about the proof. I think and think until and unless I am able to prove it.
