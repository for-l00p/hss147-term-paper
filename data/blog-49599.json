I\u0027ve seen that this is a very common issue, but i can\u0027t solve it anyway. There are some problems in which I need to print a very large int, so I use %lld (%ld is not enough in some cases). How can I avoid it? I\u0027ve read many answers to similar questions, but all of them are based on C++ (use cout or cin), and the problem is that this kind of functions doesn\u0027t exist in C. What can I do? Thanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["c language","long longs"]}}
