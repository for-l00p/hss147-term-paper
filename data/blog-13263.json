Question says that we need to print minimum number of taxi required, but in test case the input are as: Input : 3 3 3 2 Output: 3 How come output be 3. Even if i manually do this in real life even then we need 2 taxi. Because maximum 4 person can sit. Therefore total becomes 8. 8/4 we get 2. So we need 2 taxi.
