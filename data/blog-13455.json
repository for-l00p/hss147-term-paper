My suggestion is that we should keep a VERY HIGH expected rating for newly registered users(Many of which are fake accounts of div1 users) which would make it difficult for the newly registered users to make a high rating after the first match and after that they would be rated normally . Also the ratings of already registered div2 users would be affected less using this .
