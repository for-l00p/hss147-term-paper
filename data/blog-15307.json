And my solution is : \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/2cC2Fb\"\u003ehttp://ideone.com/2cC2Fb\u003c/a\u003e I am using dp and finding out dp[k][i] i.e. the maximum sum of k subsets of the size m from 1 to i in the given array input. Thus, that sum is computed as :\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003edp[k][j]\u003d max(dp[k-1][j-size]+sum[j],dp[k][j-1]);\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eI.e for a given K, i\u0027ll get the maximum of the addition of sum (k-1) subset which ends at j-size, size here is m +sum[j] which is basically the subset [j-size,j]. Either I am including this or I am not including thi, the deciding factor is the maximum sum. I am getting WA on 22nd test case. I thought it\u0027s exceeding the range, and so made it unsigned long long int also, but then it gives Memory limit exceeded. I went across one of the solution, I only saw the memory used by the arrays and it was the same as of my code. Then, why such error?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dp","implementation","467c"]}}
