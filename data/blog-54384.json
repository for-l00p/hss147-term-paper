It will help us a lot with our research. The language in which you were solving problems doesn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe won\u0027t publish your code anywhere, and won\u0027t use the credentials in any way except for crawling the solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBesides that a reminder that we have a labeling platform where we are trying to rewrite competitive programming problem statements in a short concise way. We pay for doing it, and many people who are presently helping us are making $12/hour.
