My segment tree nodes store the number of \u0026quot;active\u0026quot; elements in the range that it represents and the sum of all those elements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we see an element we sum up all of the elements that are lesser than it, and let\u0027s call it \u003ccode\u003elsum\u003c/code\u003e. As we know how many numbers were added to get \u003ccode\u003elsum\u003c/code\u003e, we can easily calculate one part of the answer. Let\u0027s do a similar thing for the numbers greater than the current one, that we have already seen and call it \u003ccode\u003ersum\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe answer must be: (Number of things less than current element)*(current element) — \u003ccode\u003elsum\u003c/code\u003e + \u003ccode\u003ersum\u003c/code\u003e — (number of elements more than this element)*(current element)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://paste.fedoraproject.org/517413/26523614/\"\u003eCODE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt gives me a WA.
