I\u0027ve been practicing DP problems but until now I\u0027d just seen problems with states like dp[i][j] \u003d best choice using i first elements and with cost j.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut when I\u0027ve tried this problem \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/425/problem/C\" title\u003d\"Codeforces Round 243 (Div. 1)\"\u003e425C - Sereja and Two Sequences\u003c/a\u003e and after thinking a couple of days, I watched the tutorial and find a dp like dp[i][j] \u003d best choice using \u0026quot;no more than\u0026quot; first i elements with j steps. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat call my attention was the part of the i parameter, because is not something fixed, if you could understand me.
