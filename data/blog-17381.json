If you have same problem, just clear history. I\u0027ll keep this blog post here for a while for those who have same issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s been a while since I can\u0027t open submissions from standing page in Chrome now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few days ago, I saw \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-red\" href\u003d\"/profile/rng_58\" title\u003d\"International Grandmaster rng_58\"\u003erng_58\u003c/a\u003e\u0027s \u003ca href\u003d\"/blog/entry/17154#comment-220713\"\u003ecomment\u003c/a\u003e, and see that I\u0027m not the only one with this issue. Though my situation is reversed: I can only open submission in Firefox (while he can only do so in Chrome).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI thought that, like some bugs that we sometimes saw in Codeforces, this will eventually be fixed, but it\u0027s been quite a time now. So now I\u0027m writing this blog to ask if any of you have same issues? Is there a fix for this? (Maybe update some plugins like Flash, etc..). I use Chrome for everything, so it\u0027s quite annoying for me to switch to Firefox just to see submissions..\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["codeforces","bug","issue"]}}
