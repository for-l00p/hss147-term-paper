It doesn\u0027t offer anything new or better than other parsers, and it\u0027s not convenient to use because of dependencies. That being said, I published it here anyway in case there are any OCaml freaks (I\u0027m not one, just a beginner) who would like to use it or contribute.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLink: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://github.com/ikatanic/cf-parser\"\u003ehttps://github.com/ikatanic/cf-parser\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
