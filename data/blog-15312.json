I could not even improve the time complexity to O(n^2log(n)) or O(n^2). It seems that this problem involves the use of a data structure.. though I do not know how to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow do you develop an O(n) solution to this problem? As i said, i have no idea how to start this problem off.. so any algorithmic ideas are appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor anyone interested, here is the full problem statement:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.codechef.com/KG14ROL2/problems/ACM14KP1\"\u003ehttp://www.codechef.com/KG14ROL2/problems/ACM14KP1\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["data structures"]}}
