I cannot debug it, since the input is truncated. I tried to reproduce a test case with similar n and k, but random id\u0027s and it is working fine, or at least it doesn\u0027t cause a runtime error. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope that such questions are appropriate for the blog and I would very much appreciate your help. I would also be very happy if you could give me some general tips on how to approach such problems (figuring out why a truncated input caused a runtime error).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
