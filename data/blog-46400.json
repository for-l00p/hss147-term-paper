My problem is, that when I run the following \u003ca href\u003d\"http://codepad.org/Cke5oMbb\"\u003ecode\u003c/a\u003e on my Mac, it works and produces the right output. When uploaded to the codeforces judge, It gives me the aforementioned error, and tells me that my program didn\u0027t output anything. I also tried compiling and running it on \u003ca href\u003d\"http://cpp.sh/\"\u003ec++ shell\u003c/a\u003e, and with compiler optimisations turned off, it compiled and produced the right answer, but with full optimisation it also didn\u0027t output anything.
