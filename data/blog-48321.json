Can anyone share his good implementation min cost max flow algorithm in some problem or give a link to any problem on cf containing this algorithm. I have seen only \u003ca href\u003d\"http://e-maxx.ru/algo/min_cost_flow\"\u003ehttp://e-maxx.ru/algo/min_cost_flow\u003c/a\u003e this implementation but not sure about asymptotics of it. Maybe anyone write it with Ford Bellman algorithm or something else? Would be very grateful :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["min cost max flow","max flow","flow","graphs"]}}
