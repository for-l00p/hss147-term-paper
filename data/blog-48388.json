The main thesis in the article is that outsourcing business\u0027 needs contradict with their customer\u0027s targets. To be more concrete, outsourcing company wants to get as much money from their client as possible, while customer wants to maximize quality/cost ratio. I am in this outsourcing world as end-programmer for quite a while and have seen many of bad things about outsourcing mentioned in the article. However, I continue to be part of all this. Then I asked myself the why I do so?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs author mentioned, there are several alternatives, like UpWork (tm) etc. Have any of you Codeforcians tried these alternative ways of getting in touch with customers who need your software? What are your feelings about all this situation?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["outsourcing","job","freelance"]}}
