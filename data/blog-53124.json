How does this DA work: First we start at vertex 1 and suppose vertex 1 is root of the path.Let call dis[i] is the shortes distance from 1 to i ,conspicuous, the shortest path from 1 to 1 is equal to 0. Now suppose we do DA sometimes , we have one set S of all vertex we have reached and we chose one of them to do dijkstra. Now we chose the vertex X which have the shortest path than other vertex in set and erase it from set . What will we do with X? Now let V is vertex connected with X by one edge. Now if dis[V]\u0026gt;dis[X]+ weight of edge connect X and V, you put V into set S because the go from 1 to X to V is better than the present path from 1 to V. I will give you my code about Dijkstra and you can understand it : \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/cjUnQ3\"\u003eLink to dijkstra code\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
