I found that all requests contain CSRF tokens but I decided to test it anyway. I copied the request to my terminal and removed the CSRF token and it worked! I tried with different requests and apparently the CSRF tokens — although they existed — were never validated. Codeforces was vulnerable to CSRF attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can read more about it on my blog : \u003ca href\u003d\"http://blog.mbassem.com/2015/05/09/codeforces-account-takeover/\"\u003ehttp://blog.mbassem.com/2015/05/09/codeforces-account-takeover/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI want to thank \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-admin\" href\u003d\"/profile/MikeMirzayanov\" title\u003d\"Штаб, MikeMirzayanov\"\u003eMikeMirzayanov\u003c/a\u003e for his fast response and fix!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour comments are welcomed!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["csrf","security","vulnerability"]}}
