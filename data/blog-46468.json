The error occurred on test case 24, which has 127 numbers in the array, while in all previous test cases, I used at most 4MB. Does anyone have an explanation? The only large chunk of memory I allotted in my code is a 200,000-longlongint array which shouldn\u0027t take more than 2MB. However, in this test case, I used 256MB and got MLE. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/615/submission/19726073\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/615/submission/19726073\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
