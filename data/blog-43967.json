In this problem, \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/653/problem/D\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/653/problem/D\u003c/a\u003e , if I use any max flow algorithm and find flow from starting node( ie 1 ) to its all neighbors.\u003cbr /\u003e Lets take an example if from node 1, four other nodes are connected with capacities 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 respectively and after applying max flow algorithm, say the flow comes out to be 3 , 5 , 6 , 6 (if we consider max flow) (these values are arbitrary here.)\u003cbr /\u003eAnd then I apply binary search. In binary search step, I am finding the total weight that all bears will carry and then dividing it by number of bears ( say I obtain k\u003d2, the weight each bear will carry). Now if using the flows obtained earlier ie 3 , 5 , 6 , 6. I try to allocate bears (that will be 1 , 2 , 3 , 3) and see if allocation is possible or not. (by comparing the bears I allocated here 1+2+3+3 \u003d 9 with bears I originally had)\u003cbr /\u003e Is this approach correct?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
