But in this problem, I do not clearly see how that principle helps to solve this problem. I can only think of a na√Øve brute force where I try each pair of numbers that sum to s and count them like that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCould anyone give me a hint as to how to approach thinking about this problem as well as other dynamic programming problems. Thanks in advance for any help. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEdit: I also want to try and avoid the editorial since it usually gives the solution away for me. Just a hint would be appreciated. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dp","8vc venture cup","help needed"]}}
