My approach is find the lcm of w1 and w2. Now on reaching lcm(w1, w2) if(lcm/w1*h1 \u0026gt; lcm/w2*h2) then we prefer h1 upto the lcm. else we prefer h2 Now for the remaining i.e from c/lcm to c, Just iterate and check which is the optimal answer. My code is \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/zh4C5tHJPG\"\u003ehttps://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/zh4C5tHJPG\u003c/a\u003e . But i get wrong answer on test 3. I couldnot figure out what is wrong. Could you help me. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["greedy","#math"]}}
