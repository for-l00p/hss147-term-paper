Problem link is [http://codeforces.com/contest/479/problem/E]. Solution is not very clear. In solution it is mentioned that dp[i][j] can be calculated in O(1) using famous technique called \u0026quot;partial sums\u0026quot;. I googled it but I could not find anything. Please help me in solution and also mention about that technique. Thanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
