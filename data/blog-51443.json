I believe my main problem is that I often come up with wrong solutions, and I struggle hour or two until I find wrong case for it. Any tips how to avoid these type of problem? Is it right to always prove solution before typing? And on the other hand how do you spend last week/days before important contests? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBTW.
