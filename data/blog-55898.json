You have to start from the source and reach the destination and visit all the interesting nodes on your path. You are allowed to visit a node multiple times but you cannot use more than n^2 nodes in your path. You have to print the path or say it is not possible. Number of nodes is 2000 and number of edges can be 2000*2000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have a O(V*E) solution for the problem. But that is not going to be enough. Can someone give any better idea? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#graph"]}}
