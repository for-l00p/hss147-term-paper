It\u0027d be great if anyone could help me find the error; the code is quite well commented. The problem seems to be in either the \u0026quot;cyc\u0026quot; method or the articulation point detection, all of which is commented. Look particularly at the comments in the \u0026quot;solve\u0026quot; method; I outlined what I found while attempting to debug. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eActually, I think there\u0027s not much need to look at create and find methods, as I tested them by checking on a SPOJ problems. However, other commented methods could contain an error that I\u0027m not sure of. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://pastebin.com/xbnfPC9q\"\u003ehttp://pastebin.com/xbnfPC9q\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance, Alex_Gu\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["debugging"]}}
