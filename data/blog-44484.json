I was looking for a tutorial and the best I found was an article from topcoder which only mentions the existence of such algorithm and presents an O(N^2logN) sweep line + BST algorithm. Can someone please tell me how to solve this faster â€” O(NlogN) or something like that. I thought about sweep line with segment tree in which I need to update an interval with 1 or -1 and get the number of zeroes over the whole interval but I couldn\u0027t come up with a way to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance! :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["rectangle union","sweep line","data structures"]}}
