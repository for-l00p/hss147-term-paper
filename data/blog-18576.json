My algorithm is to construct the convex hull of both sets of points. Now, I do a binary search on the segments of the convex hull to tell if a point is in the convex hull or not. However, I think something is wrong with implementation; can anyone help me locate bug? BTW; I try this code with and without epsilon, and it still doesn\u0027t work. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegards â€” memset123 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
