I am upsolving problems from the recent Barcelona bootcamp but for some reasons, they did not enable C++14 and my code library just gives all kinds of errors due to that. I really do not want to recode my already tested library.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
