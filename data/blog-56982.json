Fortunately, I am still young enough to celebrate a school closing :) The activity in Codeforces Blogs surprise me: so many people commented on Week 1! It\u0027s awesome!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGood news for week 1: I got a chance to look over \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/908\" title\u003d\"Good Bye 2017\"\u003eGood Bye 2017\u003c/a\u003e and try a few problems in \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/912\" title\u003d\"Codeforces Round 456 (Div. 2)\"\u003eCodeforces Round #456 (Div. 2)\u003c/a\u003e.

I also got CHelper up and running for all my Java submissions. It\u0027s really cool! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBad news for week 1: I bit off more than I can chew in C++. I only caught up to Chapter 12, and as a result have not played League ever since 1/2. Overestimating what I can accomplish is truly one of my biggest challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Week 2, I hope to finish the tasks in week 1 and do some additional work with C++. After this, week 3 will be a bunch of algorithm and problem-solving + a Codeforces contest that fits with my schedule (Finally)!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1/8: Chapters 13-14\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1/9: Chapters 15-16\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1/10: Lingering questions in the book\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1/11: Redo section 1.2 of USACO training with C++.
