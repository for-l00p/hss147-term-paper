Per language? I wrote a little program to find out, here are the results:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegions: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://pastebin.com/iteGLwqk\"\u003ehttp://pastebin.com/iteGLwqk\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLanguages: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://pastebin.com/Z6Ky63SY\"\u003ehttp://pastebin.com/Z6Ky63SY\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome things to note:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e-There are limitations here. The number of participants is calculated as the sum of participants in 1A, 1B and 1C. However, participants could\u0027ve participated in more than one of the subrounds, skewing the results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e-Language statistics are affected by the fact that go-hero counts the language even if the participant wrote just one solution in it. That leads to strange statistics — LOLCODE, for example, has a 100% advancement rate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e-Yay, Haskell!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though this is far from accurate, I found it interesting and I hope you will too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother thing that surprised me: compare the languages graph of \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.go-hero.net/jam/15/regions/China\"\u003eChina\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.go-hero.net/jam/15/regions/United%20States\"\u003eUnited States\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["google","code jam","statistics","stats","language","region"]}}
