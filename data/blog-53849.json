My thought process is as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1) Find the convex hull of all the circle centers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2) Use the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title\u003dShoelace_Theorem\"\u003eShoelace Theorem\u003c/a\u003e to find the area of the convex hull.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3) Add the area of the convex hull and the area of one circle of radius K to a running total.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4) Add the area of augmenting rectangles on the convex hull to the running total; for each rectangle, the area is found by multiplying the distance between two adjacent vertices on the hull by K (essentially the hull perimeter times K)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy implementation of these ideas is \u003ca href\u003d\"https://hastebin.com/wuvusorubu.cpp\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, which gets WA on all hidden cases.
