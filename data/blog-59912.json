The use case is I have a list of (a[i], b[i]). I want perform a query with parameter MAXB that returns the pair with the maximum value by a[i] but the corresponding b[i] value is less than or equal to MAXB. I also want to perform an update by adding a pair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you know any? Thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
