But I can\u0027t figure out the solution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuppose you have an undirected graph having \u003cstrong\u003eN\u003c/strong\u003e nodes and \u003cstrong\u003eM\u003c/strong\u003e edges given. Given graph is initially a single connected component. Now the problem is, we have to delete a \u003cstrong\u003enode\u003c/strong\u003e of the graph such that remaining graph should be a single connected component. And this process should be repeated until the graph vanishes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, we need to find the number of ways of doing it. Suppose graph is \u003cstrong\u003eN \u003d 6\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eM \u003d 7\u003c/strong\u003e as shown here \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\" Graph \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/aa/ee/aaee2eeffdbdae61585cbed234343666199bc25a.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne way to delete the above graph is 2 — 3 — 5 — 6 — 1 — 4 (order of deleting the nodes).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond way to delete the above graph is 2 — 3 — 5 — 6 — 4 — 1 (order of deleting the nodes).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother way to delete the above graph is 2 — 5 — 6 — 3 — 1 — 4 (order of deleting the nodes).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIncorrect way of deleting the graph is 1 — 2 — 3 — 4 — 5 — 6 (Graph got disconnected after deleting node 1)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan anybody help me with this question solution?
