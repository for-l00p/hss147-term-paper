My solution is as follows: 1. Create the set of the angles, which have an integer value and are the angles of regular polygons (size of polygons: min 3, maximum 100,000, because after that the angle alpha satisfies the next condition: 179 \u0026lt; alpha \u0026lt; 180); 2. Check if the input angle is in our set and output YES or NO based on this. Finished.

How would you solve it? Is there a special mathematical property to calculate the angle of an arbitrary regular polygon?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
