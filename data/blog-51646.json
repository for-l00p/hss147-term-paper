I need to find the count of maximum mutually equidistant collinear points.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMutually equidistant points here means, Every point on that line should be at equal distance with its neighbouring point on that line only (1,1 -\u0026gt; 3,3 -\u0026gt; 5,5 -\u0026gt; 7,7).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA line would be discarded if it contains non-mutually equidistant points(or point). (1-1 -\u0026gt; 3,3 -\u0026gt;5,5 -\u0026gt; 6,6-\u0026gt; 7,7 is an invalid line).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI came up with N^3 complexity approach, i.e consider any two points and check for every other point for collinearity and after each iteration , checking whether all the collinear points are mutually equi-distant or not. It\u0027s too slow to work. Is there any better approach?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["computational geometry","collinear"]}}
