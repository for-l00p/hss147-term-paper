But these days I really often come across some strange topics by this user \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-blue\" href\u003d\"/profile/dbektemirkgkdm\" title\u003d\"Expert dbektemirkgkdm\"\u003edbektemirkgkdm\u003c/a\u003e. All topics look the same way — the content of the blog contains some link and those posts get \u003ca href\u003d\"http://store.picbg.net/pubpic/C2/6A/f94d0f205220c26a.png\"\u003ea huge amount of upvotes in no time\u003c/a\u003e.

I posted a comment with the link to the original topic, asking why he was doing that and guess what — my comment got something like -20 in 3-4 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs there any way Codeforces can prevent such things happen? I think it should be stopped :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["bot","contribution"]}}
