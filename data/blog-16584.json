I am not sure I understand the dp process correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI define the state as dp[i][j], which means the max sums until the i-th position and j pairs. so, \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003edp[i][j] will update dp[i+m][j+1] (including numbers starting from i+1 to i+1+m)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003edp[i+m+1][j+1](including numbers starting from i+2 to i+2+m)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e....\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut this solution exceed the time limit.
