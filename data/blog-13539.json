However I feel like my solutions are always not good enough. I\u0027ve been to a lecture of \u003ca href\u003d\"http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module\u003dMemberProfile\u0026amp;cr\u003d10597114\"\u003ePsyho\u003c/a\u003e where he explained some approaches. I know in theory things like Beam Search, Simulated Annealing, Hill climbing. However when I face a marathon task I really have a hard time to choose which one to use and more importantly, how exactly to construct it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTake a simple NP-Hard problem as the Travelling Salesman. I have no clue how to solve it using any of the above techniques, and I would probably end up using some randomized short backtracks, which would end up with a horrible score.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would be very grateful if someone could give me some tips, and perhaps explain some not-too-hard approach for the Travelling Salesman problem, so I can learn from that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance! :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
