I am hoping you could help find it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately I have not been able to find it in English, however the core is:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour are given a sequence of N (1 \u0026lt; N \u0026lt; 1000000) bits and are asked to perform Q (1 \u0026lt; Q \u0026lt; 1000000) operations. Operations of type 1 (\u0026quot;1 n\u0026quot;) which indicates that bit number n has been flipped; and of type 2 (\u0026quot;2\u0026quot;) which you should answer with the length of the largest contiguous subsegment of zeroes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInput:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eN Q (the N bits)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Q lines with the querys)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEx:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e10 5\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1001011010\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1 4\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1 3\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1 3\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have thought of several solutions however the best complexity I can think of is O((N+Q)logN) with fenwick trees which is too slow given the order of magnitude of both N and Q. What do you think, how could the complexity be lowered? I would really appreciate any help, thanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
