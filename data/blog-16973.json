Recently I encountered one problem which turned out to be unexpectably hard for me. How to compute number of correct bracket sequences of given length? Correct bracket sequence are defined ass follows:\u003cbr /\u003eEmpty string is a correct bracket sequence\u003cbr /\u003eIf R is a correct bracket sequence then (R) is also a correct one\u003cbr /\u003eIf R and Q are correct bracket sequences then RQ is also a correct one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn site where I encountered it we have \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003en\u003c/i\u003e ≤ 60\u003c/span\u003e (\u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003en\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e is the total length of a sequence) which seems pretty small, but I\u0027m unable to solve this either way. After some thought I noted that \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003en\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e has to be odd, but it was the only helpful observation I came up with after long time. Using backtrack is clearly too slow, so I optimized this using \u0026quot;Meet In The Middle\u0026quot; technique, but that is too slow as well. Any help will be appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["counting","bracket","sequence","helpmeee","iforgottologout"]}}
