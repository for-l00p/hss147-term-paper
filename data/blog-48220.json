This problem is rather hard and if you try the first implementation which comes to your mind, it probably will not work. That comment explained a tricky binary search where you should store not two endpoints of a segment, but three, and which was easy to implement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, now I cannot neither recall the idea nor find the comment itself.
