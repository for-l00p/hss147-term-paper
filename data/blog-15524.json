After debugging the solution i found that there was some problem while taking input of 2nd array od[](order array). The sequence in which input is being fed and the sequence which is stored in od[] array are completely different for test case 4(I found this by printing first few elements of od[] array for test case 4 i.e. n\u003d500). It would be very helpful if someone could point out the mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuestion link: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/500/C\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/500/C\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy solution in C++: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ideone.com/l9otVc\"\u003ehttps://ideone.com/l9otVc\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolution in C : \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ideone.com/xbwRr6\"\u003ehttps://ideone.com/xbwRr6\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["constructive"]}}
