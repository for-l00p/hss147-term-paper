So I have to resubmit the solution several times until it shows up as a contest submission. I noticed that when it says that the contest has ended, it also says that manager mode is activated. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt seems that manager mode is being activated somehow when submitting a solution. Did anyone else have this problem?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["bug","mashup","stopreadingtags"]}}
