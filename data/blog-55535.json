Prove that there exists a sub-array of the first array and a sub-array of the second array with the same sum.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was thinking of applying pigeonhole principle using difference of prefix sums but could not get anything concrete. Any ideas about how to prove this ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
