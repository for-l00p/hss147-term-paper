I want to hear your suggestions on if its correct and how you would solve it. Thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet G \u003d (V,E) be a graph. Lets assume we know how to solve the MST using Kruskal as that is trivial. At each step of Kruskal, consider an edge e\u003d\u0026lt;a,b\u0026gt;. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf e does not cause a cycle then it is in MST Otherwise It can cause a cycle. Now consider all edges in such a cycle and take the biggest edge in the cycle e1. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClaim : If we maintain the value (e-e1) and minimize it over all cases where adding an edge will introduce a cycle then we would have the 2nd best MST by simply replacing e1 with e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs this true ? How would you solve this problem ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["graph","mst","kruskal","spanning tree"]}}
