Once I thought this is because \u0026quot;%lld\u0026quot; doesn\u0027t work in Codeforces\u0027 system. However, I happened to submit code using (#define LLD \u0026quot;%l\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ld\u0026quot;) and use the macro LLD for printf, and it works all the time just like \u0026quot;%I64d\u0026quot;, does anyone know the reason?
