Recently, I was thinking about a one problem and now I want to share it with you:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou have two arrays of the same length n, and you have to calculate minimum number of swaps of two arbitrary indexes which transform the first array A into the second B. ( All elements in arrays are not neccessery distinct ) I know how to solve this problem when all elements are distinct in O(n). Do you know how to solve common problem in effective asymptotics? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["permutations","minimum number of swaps"]}}
