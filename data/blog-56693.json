It seems to me that the solution is \u003cimg align\u003d\"middle\" class\u003d\"tex-formula\" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/f3/90/f3906115d286411a582b0417e03712610c114b8f.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e or something like that but I cannot prove it. So can someone either provide a counter sample or help me prove it.
