So last week I tried my hand in writing blogs. Apparantly I wasnt very good at it and my first blog ended up getting -50 votes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut that pathetic result didnt make me quit. I took a resolve to get better instead of merely hanging my boots.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo my last 3 blogs have had votes of -31, -28 and -18 respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs it can clearly be seen, I\u0027m improving gradually. Who knows, some time in the future my blogs may generate +200 votes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHoping for more improvement in next week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLol\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["weekly","review"]}}
