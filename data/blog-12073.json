If the value of any number in the sequence is larger than 2^16 — 1 after the operation, you should divide its value by 2^16 and take the remainder as its value;\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e2) Query  Given a non-negative number T , query how many numbers in the sequence satisfies the condition that its bitwise and result with 2^T is greater than zero.\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eFor simplicity, all you need to do here is to output the sum ( sum \u0026lt; 10, 000, 000, 000 ) of the answers to all queries.\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eCan anybody give me some idea to think this problem?\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["need help","data structures","regional"]}}
