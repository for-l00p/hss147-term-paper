Graph also has a start vertex. It says that the result is a minimum spanning tree of the graph. I couldn\u0027t understand why the answer is a minimum spanning tree. Can\u0027t a vertex of a minimum spanning tree have more than one adjacent vertex which is impossible for a tree to be the result? Can someone explain where I\u0027m wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["mst"]}}
