Problems which give you moments like \u003ca href\u003d\"http://imgur.com/H6rIR4S\"\u003ethese\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese problems are usually hard to get right for the following reasons:\u003c/p\u003e \u003col\u003e   \u003cli\u003eCorner test cases\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eTricky implementation\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eTypically problems which involve string manipulation, geometry or problems involving decimal precision are hard to get right in the first go without overlooking some minute details. Sometimes these problems require carefully breaking it up into cases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecently I solved the following \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/509/problem/C\"\u003eproblem\u003c/a\u003e and had 4 failed attempts before finally getting it right. In a competition, you might spend a ton of time trying to identify your bugs and that can make or break your final rank in the contest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo here is what I want to ask the top programmers in the community -\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ.\u003c/strong\u003e How do you approach such problems during live contests? I have seen many top programmers getting AC on such problems in the first try.
