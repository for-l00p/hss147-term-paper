Suppose We have infinte (or \u0026gt;\u003dN) flags of each of r colors. We have to find an arrangement of N flags using these flags . How many ways can this be done. (So a1 + a2 + .... ar \u003d N where ai is number of flags of color i but since this is an arrangement, shuffling within the N flags is possible).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2) No shuffling but similar sets should be counted only once. i.e (a1,a2,a3) \u003d (1,1,2) is same as (a1,a2,a3) \u003d (2,1,1)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, what is a good blog/site/resource for intermediate-hard counting/combinatorics problems (with editorials/theory).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["combinatorics","counting"]}}
