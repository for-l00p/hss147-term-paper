I\u0027m currently trying to solve \u003ca href\u003d\"http://poj.org/problem?id\u003d3260\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e problem, and since I can\u0027t solve it, I looked at the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://contest.usaco.org/TESTDATA/DEC06.fewcoins.htm\"\u003eeditorial\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt said: \u003cem\u003eLet V be the largest coin value, and call this type of coin silver and all other coins brass. It is not difficult to prove that for any change amount of at least V^2, it is possible to use at least one silver coin (hint: consider the partial sums modulo V), and hence that in making change of at least 2V^2 there can be at least V silver coins. Now if Farmer John pays at least 2V^2, and hence pays with V coins, then a similar argument shows that some set of them adds up to a multiple of V and at most V^2, which can be cancelled out with the silver coins in the change. So the change amount can never exceed 2V^2.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat does this mean? And how do we prove this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
