If this is indeed so, a possible solution to alleviate the server load would be to simply limit the number of participants in any given contest: only allowing a fixed number of people to register for the contest â€” first come, first serve. A limited-access contest is better than \u0026quot;no\u0026quot; contest at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShould Codeforces do this?
