I am having problem trying to upsolve the \u0026quot;Max Score\u0026quot; problem which was used in HackerRank\u0027s Rookie Rank 3.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/rookierank-3/challenges/max-score\"\u003elink\u003c/a\u003e to the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter reading the editorial, I am puzzled why the recurrence does not consider all permutations of elements in subset(S,i) because the order in which we choose the elements in the subset also affects the overall sum.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor easier reference, I have reproduced the puzzling part of the editorial \u003ca href\u003d\"/predownloaded/70/09/7009c7eeee299e4e204aadf03b9f2a0a6d8b3271.jpg\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. Credits to HackerRank for the editorial.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI tried asking in the problem\u0027s forum but I have not received any reply for more than 3 weeks. Could someone please advise me why we do not need to consider all permutations of elements?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#hackerrank","#dp"]}}
