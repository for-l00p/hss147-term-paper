For example I wrote a code like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://textb.org/r/precision/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInitially the numbers I am multiplying are 2, 10, 10, 10 i.e product should be 2000 but what I get is 1999. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI usually see people use some small value like EPS (10^(-6) or 10^(-10)) in their code. Even while comparing double they do it like abs(a-b)\u0026lt;\u003dEPS, then equal else not. They do not do directly like a!\u003db.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease someone explain the above observations and how to effectively take care of it in competitions. Many a times, after passing pretest we fail system tests due to precision errors. What value of EPS (epsilon) do you set or decide from the problem constraints. Please discuss your approach. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["precision"]}}
