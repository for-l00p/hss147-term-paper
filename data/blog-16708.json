I know that we have to find if there exists a order of alphabets such that name1\u0026lt;name2, name2\u0026lt;name3, name3\u0026lt;name4,and so on... but i could not help out how it is implemented and what is the basic idea behind this topological sorting algorithm? Can someone please help . ? Thanks in advance. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
