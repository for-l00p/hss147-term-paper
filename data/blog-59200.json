You construct expressions from these two lists so that:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe numbers in the expression are drawn from the first list, without repetition and without altering their order. All the operators in the second list are used in the expression, in the same order. For example, if the two lists are [1,3,2,1,4] and [′∗′,′+′], the set of possible expressions you can form are 1∗3+2,1∗3+1,1∗3+4,1∗2+1,1∗2+4,...,2∗1+4 For each expression, the value is computed by bracketing operators from the right. That is, the expressions above are evaluated as 1∗(3+2),1∗(3+1),1∗(3+4),1∗(2+1),1∗(2+4),…,2∗(1+4). The aim is to determine maximum value among these expressions.In this example, the maximum value is 18, from the expression 3*2+4, which is evaluated as 3∗(2+4). You may assume that the length of the first list is more than the length of the second list. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow do I solve this problem ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
