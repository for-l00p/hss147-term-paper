I love div 1 contest, and if I have free time I take part in it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI noticed only one thing, in my opinion wrong.When we have only div 1 contest, div 2 users can\u0027t participate (at least unofficialy).Since there are many div 2 contestants , I think it would be fair to allow them to unofficial contest.They have different rooms,don\u0027t have rating and pressure , like div 1 users in only div 2 rounds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf div 2 competitors agree , It would be nice to change that in the upcoming contest :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for reading , and sorry , I\u0027m really trying with English.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["div 1","advice"]}}
