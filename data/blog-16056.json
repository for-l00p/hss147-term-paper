Run over the row and column, check the condition on four cells in square. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this problem, we found that user: quocnhan1843 had accepted after 8 submission. I think there are some problems with his Internet connection or his new operating system. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProblem B — Meeting\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith small data input (1000 points and the value doesn\u0027t exceed 1000) you can use brute-force again! I see that some contestant used vector to store points for checking condition or iterate 4 edges of the rectangle. This is ok at all. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTest hack: Some of contestant got a wrong answer because check point at the corner twice. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOh! Sorry, I must go now. So, I will write editorial for 3 last problems later. I\u0027m very kind of you if you share your solution for this editorial. Share to be shared! Thanks\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
