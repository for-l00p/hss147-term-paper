If anyone could give me pointers, that would be greatly appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy submission is \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/446/submission/33328941\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/446/submission/33328941\u003c/a\u003e and it failed on problem 41. I\u0027m really confused on how the answer could be 4. The possible subsegments of length 4 created from [7 2 3 1 4 5] are [7 2 3 1] [2 3 1 4] [3 1 4 5] and none of them can be turned into strictly increasing arrays when changing only up to one element.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe I totally misinterpreted the problem but if that\u0027s the case, I don\u0027t know how I manged to get 40 problems correct...\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
