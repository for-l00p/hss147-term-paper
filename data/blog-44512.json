I\u0027ve just started working on some DP + graph problems recently, but I\u0027ve gotten stuck on one. It gives you a graph with exactly one simple cycle with no other vertices (all n vertices are on the cycle) and ask you to find the total cost of the maximum independent set of the graph. I know that it is a modification of maximum independent set on trees, but I don\u0027t know how to deal with the cycle. The farthest I\u0027ve gotten is adding the first node as node n+1 and the dp recurrence. Can someone help me?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
