I keep getting WA on test case 74, and I can\u0027t figure out why. \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/558/submission/12138681\"\u003eThis is my latest submission without debugging code.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy code works like this: I first turn all the replies into [L, R] ranges on the bottom row. Then I take all the \u0026quot;yes\u0026quot; replies, and use all of them to get an initial, single [lo, hi] bound on the exit node. I sort the \u0026quot;no\u0026quot; replies in ascending order of L, then iterate through them, while updating lo. If at any time, lo \u0026gt; hi, we can end the loop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor each of the \u0026quot;no\u0026quot; replies, check if there\u0027s any gap between lo and L. If there is, those gaps are all possible exits, and deal with them like that. Regardless, set lo to be max(lo, R + 1) at the end of every loop, as we\u0027ve handled all possible nodes \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e ≤ \u003ci\u003eR\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the program, do some casework, and output different answers based on that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe program works for the first 73 cases, but it outputs \u0026quot;Data not sufficient!\u0026quot; for test case 74, which is incorrect.
