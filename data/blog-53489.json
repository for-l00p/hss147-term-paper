In \u003ca href\u003d\"http://agc018.contest.atcoder.jp/tasks/agc018_d\"\u003eproblem D\u003c/a\u003e you were asked to find the length of the largest Hamilton Path in a complete graph with edges between two vertices equal to the length between these two vertices in a given tree. In the problem you need to find just the length of the path and the solution which I found to the problem can do this. But unfortunately it can just give the length of the path, not the order in which we visit the vertices (my solution is similar to the one in the editorial). So is there a solution with which the order we visit the vertices is easily recoverable (well actually even if it\u0027s not easy I would appreciate if you share your idea) and also is still fast enough (something like \u003cimg align\u003d\"middle\" class\u003d\"tex-formula\" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/e9/82/e9824f6612c4b83669d669fe6fd4d9e558305dfd.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e or faster). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["atcoder","tree","hamilton paths"]}}
