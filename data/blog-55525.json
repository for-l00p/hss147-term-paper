We came to learn about it only few days ago, which means that it is impossible to attend physically next week. Luckily, there is an online version for the course, and our University is willing to pay it for us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the website, under the category of online partitcipation, there is no clear instructions of how to register. So, what we have done is filling the registration form on their website. We do think that is not the correct way in our case, because we never saw some satement about online participation. Can someone from the origanizers guide us please ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother question concerning the camp. There are 2 divisions A and B.
