They are geared toward beginners (those with very little experience). They are far from complete (first drafts), but please let me know what you think of them!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are some small details that I sort of ignore in order to make the presentation easier (again, this is for beginners). One such error is section 3.4 on the array pdf (you can get an O(1) `set\u0027 with sqrt decomposition) â€” this is intentional. Not all of them are intentional, so if you notice any errors please let me know. Thank you and I hope you enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey are located here:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://acm.cise.ufl.edu/ufpt/\"\u003ehttp://acm.cise.ufl.edu/ufpt/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eor if you don\u0027t want to click twice:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://acm.cise.ufl.edu/ufpt/intro_to_array_datastructures.pdf\"\u003ehttp://acm.cise.ufl.edu/ufpt/intro_to_array_datastructures.pdf\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://acm.cise.ufl.edu/ufpt/intro_to_flow_networks_pt1.pdf\"\u003ehttp://acm.cise.ufl.edu/ufpt/intro_to_flow_networks_pt1.pdf\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://acm.cise.ufl.edu/ufpt/intro_to_trees.pdf\"\u003ehttp://acm.cise.ufl.edu/ufpt/intro_to_trees.pdf\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["segment tree","maximum flow","flow networks","trees","lowest common ancestor","lca"]}}
