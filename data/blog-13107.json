I can\u0027t formulate the recurrence relation exactly. Can anybody help me to formulate the recurrence relation,please? I can think of three state recurrence f(n,k,largest) \u003d how many was we can express n as sum of k distinct integers where none of the integers is greater than largest. If somehow I could compress the last state(largest) by a and k , I could use matrix exponentiation. But how can I eliminate this state?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["matrix exponentiation","recurrence","math"]}}
