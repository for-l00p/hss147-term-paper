It\u0027s very convenient, but there are tools on the internet that make this process more comfortable in several cases: for example, a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://csacademy.com/app/graph_editor/\"\u003egraph editor\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href\u003d\"https://csacademy.com/app/geometry_widget/\"\u003ea geometry widget\u003c/a\u003e (there was a nice \u003ca href\u003d\"http://jacob-jackson.appspot.com/point_viz.html\"\u003epage\u003c/a\u003e by \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-red\" href\u003d\"/profile/zxqfl\" title\u003d\"International Grandmaster zxqfl\"\u003ezxqfl\u003c/a\u003e, but it seems to be expired or something). All these services allow to obtain visualizations from some (debug-)print-friendly format, which can save your time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce I decided to write a tool for drawing grids (as I remember, it was approximately when I was solving the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.russiancodecup.ru/ru/championship/round/59/problem/C/\"\u003etask\u003c/a\u003e from the last russiancodecup).
