A few days ago I have solved a Problem on UVa named Virtual Friends . \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe link is here : \u003ca href\u003d\"https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/115/p11503.pdf\"\u003eClick Here\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is a Union Find / Disjoint Set Find problem . I used that algorithm and Got Accepted verdict at 2.281 Sec. Although the problem says it\u0027s Time Limit is 10 Sec. May be the data set is Huge. I have seen the Best Submission ever for this problem is 0.104 Sec.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow my Question is how to decrease my Run Time?? I want to get Accepted verdict less than 1 Sec. How to optimize my Code ??\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy Code is : \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/34YqH9\"\u003ehttp://ideone.com/34YqH9\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks is Advance.**\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["uva 11503","less run time"]}}
