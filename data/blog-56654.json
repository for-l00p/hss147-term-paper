I know of \u0026quot;Fleury’s Algorithm\u0026quot; , but as far as I know (and I know little), this algo is for directed graphs only.. Also came to knew about \u0026quot; Hierholzer’s Algorithm\u0026quot; but this also seems to be working on undirected graphs..\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem that I was attempting -- \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/508/problem/D\" title\u003d\"Codeforces Round 288 (Div. 2)\"\u003e508D - Таня и пароль\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe editorial of this problem mentions some points regarding finding euler path on directed graphs but it\u0027s not very clear and provides no explanation...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease can some one help me and also possibly provide me with resources where I can study this?!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHave a nice day!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["euler paths","directed graph","algorithms","help"]}}
