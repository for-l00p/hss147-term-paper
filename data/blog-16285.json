I\u0027ve tried decomposing the number of nodes, n, into its factors (in O(sqrt(n)) time), and then using dp on the factors, but this algorithm doesn\u0027t work due to the strict TL. Are there any other ideas on this problem? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/gym/100523/attachments/download/2798/20142015-ct-s02e07-codeforces-trainings-season-2-episode-7-en.pdf\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e for the problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance, sdf89013\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["trees"]}}
