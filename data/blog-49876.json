I was getting WA in \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/651/problem/B\" title\u003d\"Codeforces Round 345 (Div. 2)\"\u003e651B - Красота картин\u003c/a\u003e and check someone else\u0027s code. I saw they just checked the max number of times any integer was repeated and deducted that number from the original input of test cases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuppose the input for cases was 5, the numbers were 100,100,100,200,200. the maximum amount of time one number was repeated is 3, coz 100 was repeated 3 times. so, 5-3 \u003d 2, which is the number given as the answer and that is the correct answer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the problem is, I don\u0027t understand why this approach works. Can anyone help me with this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
