I know this task can be accomplished using hashing too, but I need help with a Trie based solution so that I can understand Tries better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, I Have written a solution in Java almost identical to another solution that has been written in C++. The C++ based soltuion gets an AC, whereas I keep getting TLE on test case 33. The AC code does not belong to me and I\u0027ve used it only for learning purpose .
