First, I \u0026quot;lock\u0026quot; my solutions when they pass pretests. Then I look in the Standings area for other people with submissions that are in bold font. I doubleclick and/or control-click that cell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI get a popup, but for other people the only thing I ever see is a single line like \u0026quot;00:06:47 Pretests passed [pretests] â†’ 8184534\u0026quot;. Clicking the submission number there, which is a link, does nothing, it just goes to the standings page.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf I do this on my OWN submissions, I see my source code in the popup. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know this is a dumb question because I see other people are successfully hacking. :-) But any help would be appreciated. I\u0027ve tried in Chrome and IE11 browsers. Thanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["hacking"]}}
