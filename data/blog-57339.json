The lecture tomorrow (today?) is going to be at 10am as well. It will cover bipartite matchings + similar problems (bipartite max. independent sets, etc.) as well as some extra material about network flows.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of you asked me to prepare a practice contest with problems on network flows. I\u0027ve asked some of my colleagues to share problems with me, so I expect to prepare the contest by tomorrow afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere will be two lectures on 27th starting at 8:30am. The topic will be string algorithms: in the first part KMP, z-function, and tries; in the second part suffix structures (mostly suffix automaton).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
