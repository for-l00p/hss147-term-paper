When I enter the site, it showed me a usual site for a moment. But after that, it turned to blank webpage with only a string \u0026quot;What does this code do?\u0026quot;. I saw the webpage\u0027s HTML code and found out there\u0027s an unusual javascript snippet in the blog entry. I thought it\u0027s kind of an XSS attack and tried again with \u0026quot;block javascript\u0026quot; option on.(and then I could see the usual site)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure why this happened, but hope this won\u0027t last long. If the administrator of the Codeforce can see this, please fix it soon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ep.s. The author of that article(with harmful script) is \u0026quot;10minutemail\u0026quot;, it seems he(or she) used a temporal mail. But I believe that Codeforces\u0027 server log can help find out who he/she is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ep.s.2. I\u0027m not sure if the \u0026quot;Add Images\u0026quot; work without Javascript, so I add the imgur link for what I found ( \u003ca href\u003d\"http://imgur.com/a/vSEOT\"\u003ehttp://imgur.com/a/vSEOT\u003c/a\u003e )\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
