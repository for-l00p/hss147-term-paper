However, I can\u0027t get the way to solve this problem. Maybe anyone knows the approach to solve this problem? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know that game theory type problem often require to compute the grundy number. But as far as I know, computing the grundy number is just the identifier whether the state is losing state (grundy number \u003d 0) or winning state (grundy number !\u003d 0). However, this problem required to output condition where the result may be a draw and I don\u0027t know what is the grundy number representation for a draw. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe do anyone know how to compute the grundy number if the solution is computing the grundy number?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks anyway!! Good day to you..\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
