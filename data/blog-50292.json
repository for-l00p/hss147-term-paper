That was quit a pain. Main objective of this plugin was not to go back and forth between my shell and vim.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve written and been using this plugin for a while. you can check on the details on \u003ca href\u003d\"https://github.com/ex-surreal/vim-std-io\"\u003eGithub\u003c/a\u003e. Main feature of this plugin is that, you can give the input test case in a buffer and it\u0027ll show the output in another buffer. Also it saves the i/o history so that you can run all the cases at once!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d be very happy if this plugin helps anyone! Any suggestion is welcomed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["editor","vim","plugin"]}}
