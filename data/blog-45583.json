For each points, you should find the smallest distance between itself and other points, in respect of euclidean distance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had no idea on the solution of this problem (except Delaunay triangulation. I hope there\u0027s a simpler solution), so I googled for the solution : \u003ca href\u003d\"https://github.com/anurag-jain/spoj-1/blob/master/MLE.cpp\"\u003ehttps://github.com/anurag-jain/spoj-1/blob/master/MLE.cpp\u003c/a\u003e but I still have no idea why it\u0027s O(NlgN).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan someone help me with this problem?
