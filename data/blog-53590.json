If you look through his blog and comments, you will notice that nothing would contribute to such figure.

And in between, I am quite certain I did not see any blog posted by either of them which would provide them with such contribution. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI suspect that they(or he) get their(or his) upvotes by making a blog post and upvoting it before deleting it immediately. Would be great if codeforces admin can look into this issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
