When i was using c++ string to store the string i got Runtime error/Time limit exceeded as the judge response but the solution got successfully executed when i used a char array with size 100005. I would like to know the reason behind it? Thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["c++ 14","codechef","string"]}}
