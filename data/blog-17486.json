Running the code on a custom test with the input of test 26 also gives the wrong answer. However when I run the code on my side, it gives the correct \u0026quot;yes 2 5\u0026quot; answer. I can\u0027t figure out why this is happening, or how to fix it. If someone could help me or at least run the code on their machine and let me know if the answer is correct or not on their side, that would be great :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe submission: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/451/submission/10786678\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/451/submission/10786678\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInput that causes problems: 5 373362086 994096202 767275079 734424844 515504383\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCorrect answer: yes 2 5\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOutput I get when I run my code: yes 2 5\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOutput the jury says my code gives: no\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
