In Wikipedia it is written that it is an optimised version of the heap sort, but instead of using binary heaps it uses heaps with size of the numbers of Leonardo. I got interested in it and started to seek for more information about it but, unfortunately, I was not able to find much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf someone could provide me with more information about Smoothsort(or Leonardo Heaps) or implementation of it in C/C#/C++, I would be really grateful!
