Yep ,I tried Google But in vain, there is no information for Asian countries ,which are leaders in this subject( Korea , Japan , China , Vietnam , Thailand , Indonesia etc.) and strong European countries( post-soviet and north-east ) , and not only that .Finding all that maybe easy for you if you\u0027re native and you\u0027re involved with this Olympiads .Better ignore it than post senseless comments !
