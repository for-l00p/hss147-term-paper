Our problem is: try to produce \u0026quot;x\u0026quot; and find how many 0\u0027s at the end of the binary representation of \u0026quot;x\u0026quot;. Because j%2\u003d\u003d0 (if j is in binary representation, you can see a the last bit is 0),which contributes a zero at the result, we add it here. The operation of \u0026quot;x+\u003d1\u0026quot; will contribute, too. So in the end, we add up to ans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["valera and number","tutorial"]}}
