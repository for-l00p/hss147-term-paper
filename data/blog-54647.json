And I even learnt suffix arrays recently. I want to become even more stronger in competitive programming. I want to solve hard problems on sgu specifically. But I am not able to find any problem classifiers anywhere. Can anyone suggest me some hard problems on sgu? Hard in the sense I mean those which can\u0027t be solved by a purple or yellow coder. Thanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
