The edges that can be added cannot be removed, and the edges that are being removed, cannot be added back. We initially have a graph too, so basically, the edges that are present in the initial graph can be removed, and new edges can be added, but the edges that are added later cannot be removed. they are permanant. Is there a simpler solution to this problem, than the normal fully connected dynamic connectivity problem?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.S: can someone give me a link to any problem based on online fully dynamic connectivity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#graph","dynamic connectivity"]}}
