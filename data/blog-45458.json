Simplified Problem Statement: A set S\u003d{a,b,c,x,y} is given and a target sum is given so we have to find the elements which sums to the target sum or \u003cstrong\u003eeven very close to it\u003c/strong\u003e. I think its a DP problem but I don\u0027t know how to approach it so giving the algorithm and explanation would be very nice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["uva","uva 624","dp","programming"]}}
