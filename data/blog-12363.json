All I found is a google translated e-maxx.ru and a wekipedia page. But I could not understand all of them. I understand the graph construction and the impossible case, why and when it does not have solution. its clear to me . But I can not understand the topo sort / start time finish time part inside it. What else information can we extract form 2-SAT besides satisfiable/not?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/228/E\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/228/E\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eI found this problem as an exercise of 2-SAT.
