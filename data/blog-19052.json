So, I thought I should celebrate it by publishing a blog entry. Here it goes..., We have to find the sum of the numbers(range[1...k]) such that their sum forms n. Also it\u0027s given that there must be at least one entry with value \u0026gt;\u003dd. So this is equivalent to...\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003eRequired Number of Paths \u003d (total number of paths which sum to n using range[1...k]) - (total number of paths which sum to n using range[1...d-1])\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach of the two subproblems on the R.H.S can be individually solved using dp.
