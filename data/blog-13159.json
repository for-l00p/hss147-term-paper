But what if we change the problem to finding the minimum possible resistance of the constructed circuit( Instead of largest). This turns the problem to a more difficult one because the type-B connection is resulting into the maximum resistance of the two circuits. Is the new problem is even solvable other than brute force ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["topcoder","srm 628"]}}
