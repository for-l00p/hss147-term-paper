Circular RMQ\u003c/a\u003e. Then i faced a problem, at first i get Time limit exceeded \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/52/submission/19303990\"\u003eHere!\u003c/a\u003e, So i think that i am wrong in something like the whole idea or a bug in the code so i spent hours to find this wrong and i found nothing. But when i removed the line \u003ccode\u003ereturn min(rmq(...),rmq(...));\u003c/code\u003e randomly in rmq function and i put instead of it \u003ccode\u003eint p1 \u003d rmq(...), p2 \u003d rmq(...); return min(p1,p2);\u003c/code\u003e it actually works and get accepted \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/52/submission/19306442\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. So i think min() function go crazy or some thing when it have two recursive calls in it, am i right ? or there is another thing i don\u0027t notice ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPD\u003c/strong\u003e: Built-in min() function don\u0027t have this problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
