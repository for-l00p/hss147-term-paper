At the time of solving problem C I thought of a Union Find Disjoint Set Data Structure, I coded it and submitted such code. Since it was a virtual round, I immediately got the WA verdict, nevertheless I was sure that the idea was correct. So I made some unimportant changes, submitted again and got the AC verdict.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe thing is, when the round was over, I wanted to know what was wrong with my first submitted code. I opened the log which shows information for each test case to see what happened, but the log info for that case was blank (View the submission \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/218/submission/11613966\" title\u003d\"Submission 11613966 by LuaXD\"\u003e11613966\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was very saddened to see that the usual WA message wouldn\u0027t show up (wrong answer 1st numbers differ â€” expected: \u00271\u0027, found: \u00273\u0027). So I decided to copy my code and resubmit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe resubmission verdict was AC. Both submissions are literally the same. As you can see, one has got a WA verdict and the other has got an AC.
