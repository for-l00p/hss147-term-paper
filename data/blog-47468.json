Please, could someone tell me, is everything ok with the registration of our team on subregional contest. There are three participants, we have a coach, we\u0027ve filled all the necessary information about ourself and all the requerements are checked as ok (registration complete, on team certificate, on individual certificate), but the status of the team is \u0026quot;pending\u0026quot;. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s ok and we don\u0027t want to miss the contest because of a registration. What should we do to get a team\u0027s status \u0026quot;accepted\u0026quot; or maybe \u0026quot;confirmed\u0026quot;?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["registration","acm icpc"]}}
