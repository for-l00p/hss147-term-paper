I am a school boy of class 9. And I know/learnt these things- \u003c/p\u003e \u003col\u003e   \u003cli\u003eI have finished learning C. I code in C++ but actually inside it is C.\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eHave some basic knowledge about C++ STL library like: queue,stack,map,string,set.\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eI know what is Dynamic Programming and CAN solve easy DP problems.\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eAlso know a little bit of Graph Theory.\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eI am good at math and improving everyday.\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t take part in many contests before because of my exams in school. But I can most of the time (like 90%) solve problem A and B in DIV-2 Codeforces Rounds. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow I am like lost in a lot of things in this programming world, so many things, many many interesting stuff but can\u0027t understand most (it is awful). So please tell me what can be my best step from here. Should I practice at some OJ or like learn something new etc. Also I know that there are many people out there who are like me. So your answer could be some help to them as well\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eP.S\u003c/strong\u003e: I know my English is not good, sorry about that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
