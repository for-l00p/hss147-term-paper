This was meant no offense on anybody, I just want to express the common feeling of all the participants right now. I understand that because of the online format and multiple timezone time slots, there may be some serious problem with the scoring or appealing but I can\u0027t believe that they delay the result without any announcement even after 3 days. This makes us very confusing and longing for the result everyday. This is just my opinion, I was no meant to criticize anybody or organization, the contest was great, the server works perfectly and the problem was quite mind-bending. I just don\u0027t want such small details to ruin such wonderful contest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPD:\u003c/strong\u003e APIO finally release its result !
