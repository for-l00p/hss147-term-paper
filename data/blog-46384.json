I\u0027ve been reading about suffix trees and trying to solve a simple problem. The solution is pretty lengthy, but... Does anyone know what error code 255 is? I also tried custom tests and occasionally I get error code -1073741819. I compile under gcc 5.1.0 â€” the same as codeforces I think, using c++11. I tried using flags \u0026quot;-std\u003dc++11 -Wextra -pedantic -Wall -O2\u0026quot; but didn\u0027t get anything interesting. I\u0027ve been playing around with this for quite a while now, but I can\u0027t seem to get it to work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d be grateful for any help anyone can provide!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
