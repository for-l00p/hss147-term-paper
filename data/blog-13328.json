From what I\u0027ve seen in the codes, it seems like there\u0027s a theorem that states something like the following: If the diameter of a tree is \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ed\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, there will always be at least one node \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ev\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e such that the farthest node from \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ev\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e is no farther than \u003cspan class\u003d\"tex-span\"\u003e(\u003ci\u003ed\u003c/i\u003e + 1) / 2\u003c/span\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs there such a theorem?
