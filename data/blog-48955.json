If the graph has vertex such that its in-degree is 0 then obviously answer doesn\u0027t exists. Otherwise the graph consists of some cycles. For each cycle suppose that its length is len. If it has odd length, add len to S, otherwise, add len / 2.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnswer is the LCM of numbers in S.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am unsure why the LCM is the answer.
