You all did well on the contest. In this first blog we want to think about approaches to solve Problem \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/608/B\"\u003e608B. Hamming Distance Sum\u003c/a\u003e. No body managed to solve it during the contest but we had some submissions. First make sure that you understand what the problem is asking and then think about approaches to solve this problem: what\u0027s the brute force solution ? Are there any observations that you can make ? etc..\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTry to resist opening the editorial and posting what\u0027s in there..\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can contribute by posting questions, approaches, etc..\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["css3361","608b"]}}
