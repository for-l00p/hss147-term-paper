Sometimes, the test cases are provided if you want to test your solution on the actual test data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd here\u0027s the problem: Usually when you download these test cases, you have a folder full of .ins and .outs. So one way to test your solution, is to take every test case and copy it to your file (or stdin), run the program and compare your output with the expected output.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat I am asking, is a way to test your program to all the test cases simultaneously and after the testing, you can go to another file that describes the performance of your program. i.e. Case #1: AC  Case #2: WA  Case #3: TLE (if it\u0027s possible to check execution time too that\u0027d be great!)  ...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am sorry if there is already a similar topic at Codeforces, but I couldn\u0027t find anything on the Internet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["test cases"]}}
