Like in yesterday\u0027s contest 417(Div. 2), there was a problem C \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/812/problem/C\"\u003eSagheer and Nubian Market\u003c/a\u003e . I saw in the editorial and many solutions of the top coders as well. Some people have started binary Search with \u003cstrong\u003ewhile(low \u0026lt;\u003d high)\u003c/strong\u003e this condition, some have started with \u003cstrong\u003ewhile(high â€” low \u0026gt; 1)\u003c/strong\u003e this condition and some have did it with \u003cstrong\u003ewhile(low \u0026lt; high)\u003c/strong\u003e . I have a doubt, how do we decide that which loop condition we have to apply and how we get the answer ? Can somebody explain this with yesterday\u0027s C problem !
