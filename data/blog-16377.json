I think my rating will be increased or decreased ,about how much users with more or less rating are above or down from me. So my question is: New users,that are unrated starts with 1400 points or 0? I ask this,because if they start with 1400 and I go better than some,then that will helps my rating to be increased,but if they start with 0 and I go worse than some, then in that case my rating will be in \u0026quot;dangerous\u0026quot; case. :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you for your time !!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
