Can you please tell me how to solve it or what I\u0027m doing wrong? I guess that the \u0026quot;Martian to English\u0026quot; alphabet must be figured out from the test case examples (they include all of the 26 letters, uppercase and lowercase). So I put them in a \u0027map\u0027 and then print the answers, which is correct for the examples, but not for the 6th test.
