I noticed a problem in it. If you solve and get AC on any problem in a mashup contest, it won\u0027t be reflected in the problem page in the contest from which it was taken. For example, if you solve Problem A from Round 410 in a mashup, and then go to the Round 410\u0027s problem A page, it will be shown as unsolved. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs this a bug? Or was it intended to be like this? (which doesn\u0027t make much sense). Or do I have to wait for a certain amount of time for the change to take place? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf this is a bug, please correct this codeforces!
