Here is an interesting problem I created.\u003cbr /\u003e You are given a list of strings with total size n. We define subanagram of a string s, such string s1 that for every character c (a-z letters only) count(c, s1) \u0026lt;\u003d count(c, s) . You are given q queries. Each consists of a single string s. You have to output the number of subanagrams of s in the given list of strings. Constraints: n\u0026lt;\u003d 10^6. Length of every string \u0026lt;\u003d 30. q\u0026lt;\u003d 10^4. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#problem","#strings","#data structure","#advance data structures"]}}
