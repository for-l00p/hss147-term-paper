Recently I tried to solve them and solved one of them, but the other, I just couldn\u0027t solve. I\u0027ve tried for a while but can\u0027t come up with anything good enough, so I\u0027d love some help. Here is the shortened statement:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou are given a square of size \u003cstrong\u003eN (1\u0026lt;\u003dN\u0026lt;\u003d20,000)\u003c/strong\u003e and a list of \u003cstrong\u003eM (0\u0026lt;\u003dM\u0026lt;\u003d200,000)\u003c/strong\u003e cells that are dark, all other cells are bright. The problem is to calculate the sum of all areas of rectangles that are of the same color. That is, output the sum of all rectangles in the initial square grid that are fully dark or fully bright.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrint the answer modulo 10^9+7, since it can be very large.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInput format : N and M on one line, followed by M lines describing the coordinates of the dark cells 1-based.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eSample input:\n\n4 6\n1 2\n1 3\n2 1\n2 3\n4 1\n4 4\n\nSample output:\n\n58\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are 6 dark rectangles 1x1 and 2 dark rectangles 1x2 and in total area of 10 of dark rectangles. The total are of bright rectangles is 48, so in total 58.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m struggling to find any good solution, the format of the competition is to give output files for the given input files, so I suppose something like O(N*N) or maybe even O(N*M) could be the intended solution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["rectangles","areas","help"]}}
