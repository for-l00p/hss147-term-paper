Sadly, I didn\u0027t figure out its solution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProblem: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWalid was assigned to build a network, however the required network has its own properties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe network is divided into groups; each group is made of 2 types of nodes: Group Owners and slaves. There can be a maximum of d slaves in a group. Note: You can\u0027t have a group inside a group.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach second, r nodes will join the network. There will be a total of m insertions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA node can either declare itself as a group owner, or join an existing network if possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, for a node to declare itself as a group owner, there will be an overhead of cost d, while joining an existing network costs an overhead of weight 1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWalid task is to create a network with minimum overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eInput:\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003em : Number of insertions\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003er : Number of nodes joining the network\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003ed : Maximum number of slaves allowed per group\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOutput:\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrint the number of groups for each t, to build a network with least cost at time m.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think this problem is a DP problem.
