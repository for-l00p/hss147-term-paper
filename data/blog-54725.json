Here are two ways(with little difference) I tried https://ideone.com/zIFdC0(WA) and https://ideone.com/ipq4lw(TLE). Can anyone please say where am I possibly getting wrong ? And what can be a better(or faster) solution. How can this be done with DP , as mentioned in the comments ? Thanks, in advance. :)\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eHAPPY CODING! :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dfs and similar","graphs","#dp"]}}
