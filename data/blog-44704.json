Afterwards, I\u0027ll try out another combination from the beginning and this goes on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInitially, I overlooked the fact that I can try out combinations from tubes remaining despite using one of the reagents from the combination formed from two tubes. So, I coded a solution, of course it is buggy. But now I am facing problems in implementing what I just have explained. Any help is really appreciated. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProblem link: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/106/10604.pdf\"\u003ehttps://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/106/10604.pdf\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuggy solution link: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/h2nMTX\"\u003ehttp://ideone.com/h2nMTX\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
