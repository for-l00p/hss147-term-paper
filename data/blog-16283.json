We qualified for WF in 2014 also but did very bad and are focusing on performing better this time. For that, many people advised us to concentrate more on geometry as they can be really tricky and can make quite a good difference in the ranklist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan someone post some geometry problems which involve hard concepts which can be useful for our practice? May it be previous year\u0027s icpc problems or good problems in some online judges or any good resources to learn hard geometry concepts like blogs or tutorials. Is there any place where we can find such problems? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in Advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["geometry","acm-icpc","alorithmic resources"]}}
