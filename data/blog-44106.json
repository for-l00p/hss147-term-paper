See you next year!\u003c/p\u003e \u003chr /\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fourth April Fools Day Contest will take place on Friday April 1st. This is a joke competition in which solving the problem is often easier than figuring out what the actual task is. Thanks to \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-cyan\" href\u003d\"/profile/kit1980\" title\u003d\"Specialist kit1980\"\u003ekit1980\u003c/a\u003e and Codeforces team for their help in preparing problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this round you\u0027ll be given 7 weird problems and 2 hours to solve them. The contest will use ACM ICPC rules (no hacks, the standings are decided by the number of solved problems and penalty time earned on them), and it will be unrated. You can submit solutions in any language allowed by Codeforces â€” well, unless the problem says otherwise ;-) To get an idea of what the contest will look like, you can check out the contests of the past years: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/171\"\u003e2012\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/290\"\u003e2013\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/409\"\u003e2014\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBe warned, to enjoy competing in this round you\u0027ll need a sense of humor compatible with mine!
