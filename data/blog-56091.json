But it is hard for me to solve those variation by my own as I am a beginner. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuch as I have learned Eular trail/circuit, I have solved several problems and I thought I could be able to solve any problem related to eular trail/circuit .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut then I stuck on a problem and couldn\u0027t solve it , I tried it many hours . Then I searched for solution and seen that , this problem was chinese postman problem . Then I learned about chinese postman and solved this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSame way I learned tiling DP .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow I think I should know about those topics which are always untold. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease tell me as much topics as you can , please give me the link if you can .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOr at least tell as much topics as you can. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think this will help beginners like me. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
