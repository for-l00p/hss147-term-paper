The paper provides some references for the proof but they are nowhere to be found on the internet. I have tried a lot to come up with a proof myself but haven\u0027t been successful. I am hoping someone here can share a proof for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, I read somewhere that not only for planar graphs, it is polynomial time even for general graphs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["planar","colorings","proofs"]}}
