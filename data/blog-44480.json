Starting next week we will be teaching our course about competitive programming at Reykjav√≠k University in Iceland for the second time. The course lasts for three weeks, and we will post a new problem set and lecture material daily \u003ca href\u003d\"https://algo.is/t-414-aflv-competitive-programming-course-2016/\"\u003eon this page\u003c/a\u003e so you can follow along from home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe format of the course will be very similar to the last edition, although we\u0027ll try to bring in fresh problems for the problem sets. We would still like to get feedback from the community about the previous edition if there\u0027s anything that may be missing from the lectures or could be improved. Thanks again for all the nice messages I\u0027ve received after posting the previous edition, and I hope you\u0027ll enjoy this edition as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["university","competitive programming","courses"]}}
