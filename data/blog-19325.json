I recently took part in the July 2015 long challenge on www.codechef.com . There was a problem called Masterchef( Problem code: MCHEF). I used a multiset as a priority queue to calculate the minimum cost for each dish. In the author\u0027s solution, they used a set instead of a multiset. The complexities are the same but my solution TLEs for the second subtask. Could someone please help me out here?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is my solution: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/7352429\"\u003ehttps://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/7352429\u003c/a\u003e This is the editorial: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/71856/mchef-editorial\"\u003ehttp://discuss.codechef.com/questions/71856/mchef-editorial\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["multiset","codechef","tle"]}}
