Somehow the runtime somehow blows up in some seemingly random cases, even after switching between different random priority genreation methods.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/702/submission/31329125\"\u003eHere is my submission\u003c/a\u003e. As you can see the runtime of #12 and #16 suddenly blows up while other large cases only has a runtime less than 1second (Not to mention I barely passed #12 after switching from cin to scanf). I wonder if one of my helper functions have a larger time complexity than I anticipated (I think every treap function except pushres() is around O(lgn) ), or am I messing with pointers to much that it takes too much time to allocate space for my treap?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["treap","702f"]}}
