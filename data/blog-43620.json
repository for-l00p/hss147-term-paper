I don\u0027t know the exact name, but the problem is: Given an array of N elements, find the subsequence [i, j] such that the sum (a[i] + a[i+1] + a[...] + a[j]) maximizes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the problem I am working on (in vain), is given K queries, each is either to update (change value of) an element a[i] for some i (given in the query) or to find the Max-Sum subsequence [i, j] within the range [L, R] for some L, R (given in each query).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConstrains: N \u0026lt;\u003d 100,000, K \u0026lt;\u003d 100,000, |a[i]| \u0026lt;\u003d 10^9.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have tried but still unsuccessfully. Could someone please help me? Thank you very much!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
