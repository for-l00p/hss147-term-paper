I will take this lesson seriously. However, what makes me unnerving is that \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-green\" href\u003d\"/profile/delete4\" title\u003d\"Pupil delete4\"\u003edelete4\u003c/a\u003e still preserves his competition results of round 427 and had a decent rise in rating. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am deeply frustrated and confused by codeforces\u0027 decision. Why did \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-green\" href\u003d\"/profile/delete4\" title\u003d\"Pupil delete4\"\u003edelete4\u003c/a\u003e get a different treatment from me if we are both caught \u0026quot;cheating\u0026quot;? Is it merely a small mistake? Or someone is convinced that I am the only one who is responsible? Or there are other terrible things going on? I hope the people who is in charge can give an honest response. \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-red\" href\u003d\"/profile/KAN\" title\u003d\"Grandmaster KAN\"\u003eKAN\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-admin\" href\u003d\"/profile/MikeMirzayanov\" title\u003d\"Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov\"\u003eMikeMirzayanov\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-orange\" href\u003d\"/profile/qoo2p5\" title\u003d\"International master qoo2p5\"\u003eqoo2p5\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEdit: If finally such a horrible issue doesn\u0027t even get the attention of any people in charge, I want this post to warn other people and myself that although codeforces is a lovely place, it is also tarred by a heavily flawed justice system, opaque admin and some terrible persons. I wish everyone could protect himself and never ran into such issues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["cheating"]}}
