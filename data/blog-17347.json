I wanted to search for a value so I used \u0026quot;lower_bound\u0026quot;. I submitted and I took TLE. After I changed a bit the source,and I used find() instead of lower_bound() and I passed all testcases. Why happens that? Is find() faster than lower_bound()??\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you !!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
