Got next problem: for every 1 \u0026lt;\u003d N \u0026lt;\u003d 1 000 000 we need to found all prime divisors of N. Moreover, we aren\u0027t required to know their powers — only primes themselves. I guess we can use Eratostenes algorithm, but I can\u0027t finish my solution. Who can help?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUPD. Solutions like trivial O(sqrt(N)) and similar, as well as doing Eratostenes and then, for example, got an array \u003cem\u003eprime[]\u003c/em\u003e with primes, iterating that array and checking them are \u003cstrong\u003etoo slow\u003c/strong\u003e. We need something faster\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
