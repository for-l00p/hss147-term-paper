I\u0027m new on codeforces and programming. It\u0027s my first blog entry. Sorry for my mistakes. I know some algorithms but I can\u0027t use them in contests. I ask you books for easy (beginner) or (elementary) algorithms that every programmer should know. I would be glad if someone helps me to be a good programmer. I want to solve at least 3 or 4 problems from div2. I know that it is not impossible. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
