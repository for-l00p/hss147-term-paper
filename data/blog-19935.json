In particular, I had a cumulative frequency array which I had defined as:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003ecf[i]\u003dcf[i-1]+f[i];\u003c/code\u003ewhere f[i] was always positive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater, there was a sequence of range queries to answer, so I did:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003ecout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; cf[r]-cf[l-1]\u003c/code\u003e for each query; L, R were the range boundaries (both inclusive).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the problem stated to report the answer modulo 1000000007, so I changed my queries to:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003ecout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; (cf[r]-cf[l-1]%MOD)%MOD;\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut on seeing the intended solution, I saw that the correct query was :\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003ecout\u0026lt;\u0026lt;(cf[r]-cf[l-1]+MOD)%MOD;\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am unable to understand this, because what I knew was that (a-b)%m \u003d (a%m-b%m)%m\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan please someone explain this to me?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks!!
