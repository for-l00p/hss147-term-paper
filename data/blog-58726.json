Some people say that to solve a dynamic problem you need pure intelligence , but wouldn\u0027t agree with it. Rather i would say DP is a skill based technique .The more you practice DP the more you will be skilled. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore solving a DP problem , You have to identify whether that is a DP problem or not. Why that is a DP problem and where to apply the DP technique.if you get the point then you are one step ahead to solve that problem . \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter identifying the problem as a DP your next approach should be solve the problem using PEN and SHEET .Remember , you have to find some relation among data calculated before and you will calculate after some time. once you get the relation you can write a code easily then.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour another thinking maybe about dividing the problem and word with root part. thing at root level , that will easier to solve , then try to combine the solution . And use memorization as you know it will give you efficiency as you don\u0027t need to solve same part again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother tricks is to relate the problem with real life scenario . Think about the 0-1 Knapsak problem . what did you do ? Our approach was like whether we will take the next element or not. if we take the the next element then we will get some value otherwise the value is 0 . Another thing is forwarding skipping that element. so, if can relate the problem in real life scenario then it will easier to solve..\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally what i want to say is you have to practice a lot be be a BOSS is DP . So, practice practice and practice.. Happy DP problem Solving\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dp","problem solving skill","attacking problem","dynamic programing"]}}
