Round 92 , Task D â€” Two Sequences . . \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem is I have come to realize that maybe problems of these types are in general hard for me and I should train on them more , \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am weak at greedy problems and constructive algorithm problems . . Are there any other places except for Atcoder where I can practice problems similar to Atcoder problem D ? I want to become fast and accurate at solving D , particualrly greedy and constructive , but I cant find the same quality problems anywhere except for atcoder , and the quantity of problems there is very less , \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease help me. I need problems similar to Atcoder D for practice! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso tell me some good sources to practice my greedy and constructive problems!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#help","atcoder"]}}
