In the problem there will be 1e6 queries. I would like to know how to solve this kind of problem with complexity close to O (log n) per query.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSample:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1 7 4 5 6 7 8\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChoosing the element in the 5th position (value 6) in the range [1, 5 â€” 1] there are 2 elements greater than 6.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTks. :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
