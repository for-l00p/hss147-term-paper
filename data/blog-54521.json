Each cell value represents a value P,which denotes the number of parking spaces available in that city. A person wants to take his vehicle from city C(1,1) to city C(N,M) such that he parks his vehicle at one of the available parking spaces in any city and then he takes a taxi via which he reaches city C(N,M).He can park his vehicle in any city. We have to output the number of ways in which he can reach his destination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ethe first line contains N,M.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn each of N lines,M numbers follow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003esample input:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2 2\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1 2\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e0 1\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003esample output: 3\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI tried to use BFS but that gave wrong answers in every case except 1.Please suggest what should be the approach for this question?
