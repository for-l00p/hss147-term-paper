Thus the formula:  \u003cimg align\u003d\"middle\" class\u003d\"tex-formula\" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/74/34/7434a3c2d69719bbd9d0aa701771c36398b2ee50.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e This sum can then be divided by n!. I saw a few AC codes and somehow people have reduced it to sum of harmonic series,however Im not able to reduce my formula further.
