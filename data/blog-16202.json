To achieve this you can increase or decrease the height of any element by 1, any number of times, each modification costs 1 operation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConstraints: 5 \u0026lt;\u003d N \u0026lt;\u003d 10^6 3 \u0026lt;\u003d K \u0026lt;\u003d N 0 \u0026lt;\u003d ai \u0026lt;\u003d 10^6\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eExample: N \u003d 6 K \u003d 4 10 4 5 2 5 7\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere the solution is a group from position 2 (1-based) to position 5 (1-based), which costs 4 operations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo far I have a solution in O(Nlog^2(N)) using a binary search + segment tree, but this timed out.
