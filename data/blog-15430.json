Unfortunately, with my code (here: \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/455/submission/9279876\" title\u003d\"Посылка 9279876 от memset123\"\u003e9279876\u003c/a\u003e) I get WA test 62. I would appreciate it if someone could debug it for me.. I have tried for 1 hour unsuccessfully :(.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI will describe my algorithm here:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe will conduct a type of \u0026quot;dp\u0026quot; on each node. For each node, if it has no sons, then we are forced to win at that node. If it has a son, at which we force a loss for the first player, then the first player can win at this node (since the second player \u0026quot;becomes\u0026quot; the first player at the node\u0027s son). The first player can force a loss for himself at a node if he forces a win for the first player at any of the node\u0027s sons. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["trie","dp"]}}
