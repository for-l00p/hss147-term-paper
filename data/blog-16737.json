However the implementations I have seen doesn\u0027t change the rank while doing the find operation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have looked at Competitive Programming 3 implementation and the wikipedia implementation and both doesn\u0027t change the rank while finding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["disjoint-set","advanced data structure","union-find"]}}
