When i mark some node with a flag,i don\u0027t actually update it,i just mark it.So a node with a mark on it isn\u0027t updated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I \u0026quot;go down\u0026quot; on some son and see that my node is marked,that\u0027s when I update it and give the mark to the sons.It seems more easier than me.This way i have to be sure that when I \u0026quot;go up\u0026quot; in my recursion and update my node with the value of the sons,the sons may not actually be updated,so I need to make sure they are.This takes more time,that\u0027s why I think this approach is slower than the other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is my code for this problem \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/5672423\"\u003ehttp://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/5672423\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also tried the other approach,when I mark a node and update it.It seems faster but not so pretty for me to implement. What is your version of implementing lazy update?Please let me know :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
