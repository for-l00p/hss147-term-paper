XD\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo days ago my classmates(I\u0027m a high school student) invented this easy(but difficult :p) game.. It was just after beginning of new term and they want to find something to do so they create such game imho...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the rules are at below\u003c/p\u003e \u003chr /\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven a N*M board. Each grid contains 1 single piece\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen two players take turns to move away pieces: At each move, he can take any number of pieces in a same row or column (**NOT** necessary to be adjacent ones); The player who takes the last piece wins\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eObviously there is a optimal strategy and for given M and N the result is determined(assuming optimal playing), however this is not easy to figure out. Even for small cases(like N\u003dM\u003d4) the game will be very complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo anyone could come up for a solution?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["game theory","problem"]}}
