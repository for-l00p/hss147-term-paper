The greedy approach is incorrect and there is a quite straightforward O(N^2) dp solution which will obviously not run in time. I gave up and tried to find solutions online but I couldn\u0027t find anything but a topcoder topic where there were some hints. If anyone can explain the solution of this problem it would be great.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dynamic programming","uva"]}}
