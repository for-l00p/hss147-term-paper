Today I was solving a problem together with \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-violet\" href\u003d\"/profile/minimario\" title\u003d\"Candidate Master minimario\"\u003eminimario\u003c/a\u003e and we came across a well known-looking subproblem we couldn\u0027t solve. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are two sequences of length N, A[] and B[] with N, A[i], B[i] \u0026lt;\u003d 10^5.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur goal is to answer queries: a, b, x, y which mean : find the i in range \u0026lt;a, b\u0026gt; with the biggest value of A[i] * x + B[i] * y. 1 \u0026lt;\u003d a \u0026lt;\u003d b \u0026lt;\u003d n, -10^5 \u0026lt;\u003d x, y \u0026lt;\u003d 10^5.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs it possible to do it offline? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs it possible with operation erase as well? (erase can be seen as setting A[i] \u003d -inf and B[i] \u003d -inf).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for any suggestions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
