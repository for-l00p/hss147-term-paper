I\u0027m about to get out of my university and step into the corporate world. In India, most competitive programmers stop competing once they leave college. Most of them are in this game for sake of getting jobs at tech giants like Google, Microsoft etc. However, some people never stop competing. There are some who learnt competitive programming while being employed. If you are one of them who hasn\u0027t left competitive programming while working, I would request you to share your strategy. How do you balance to do both while still remaining strong during competitions ? I\u0027m just curious.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
