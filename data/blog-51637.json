I am now interested in this variant:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuppose a tower with no blocks ceases to exist. How would one solve this problem now? I tried but could not come on with a working solution. Example: There are 3 towers initially: 2 5 7. Suppose we can only move two blocks. Then we can achieve zero instability. Any help is appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
