The API documentation said the number of user handles can be up to 10000. However, it seems due to the restriction of nginx, even 1000 handles at a time failed because the URL was too long. So this step took longer time than I thought.\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eImport the data to LibreOffice Calc, and use the data process function to figure out the correlation between variables.\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe data I posted is based on all rated users with non-zero contribution.
