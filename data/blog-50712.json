Well, let me tell you, it\u0027s disappeared -.-\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLook what those Russians did, hide the contests from us. Well...they are too scared for more people like Edward Snowden I guess! But when you switch to russian, let me tell you, the Qualification Round 1 shows up!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan somebody tell me what\u0027s the point of this? And if it\u0027s a glitch, that\u0027s fine with me...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI want justice for all the people of Codeforces! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEdit: I\u0027d like all of you that downvoted to explain to me your rationale. I\u0027m not offended, but I\u0027m just curious as to why there are so many negative reactions to this. Yes, I understand that I am indirectly attacking Russians, but if you think about it, is it really just to hide such a contest from the non-Russian side of Codeforces? How many good reasons can you think about for this? And I\u0027d simply just like to ask you to consider what I\u0027ve said, and pose an argument of your own if you\u0027d like to contradict it. I am just pointing out an imbalance of society, whether just or not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["justice","racism","lolmagicisthree"]}}
