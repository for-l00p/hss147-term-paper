Suppose, you want to find problems related to Network flow, but there\u0027s no category for it. The only way to find them is to look at every problems under \u0026quot;Graph Theory\u0026quot; category. And there are thousands of them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, it is highly probable that a Network flow related problem\u0027s editorial page would contain the word \u0026quot;flow\u0026quot; atleast once. So, I\u0027ve written a script that looks into every editorial page, search for given keywords (in this case â€” \u0026quot;flow\u0026quot;) and list those pages where it has found a match into a html file.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://github.com/halfo/tag-tc\"\u003elink of the script\u003c/a\u003e and a sample of \u003ca href\u003d\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/11774099/\"\u003egenerated html file\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe script is still immature. There are a lot of things to do. But still, it works!! And I\u0027ll really glad if it comes to anyone\u0027s help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll forms of contribution (bug reports, bug fixes, pull requests and simple suggestions) are welcomed.
