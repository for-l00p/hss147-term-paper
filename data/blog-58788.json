So far I only know the basic Max Flow problem and the Kuhn\u0027s algorithm!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe topcoder blog I studied from \u003d\u003d\u0026gt; \u003ca href\u003d\"https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module\u003dThread\u0026amp;threadID\u003d684427\u0026amp;start\u003d0\u0026amp;mc\u003d13\"\u003eMatchings\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for helping!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["help","flows","hungarian algorithm"]}}
