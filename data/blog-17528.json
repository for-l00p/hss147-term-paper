My Online Judge (MOJ) is a page where you can connect accounts of different judges such as COJ, UVA, CodeForces, etc to share your stats with other users. You can also share your programs, news and projects. Today I started my first test phase on the page and I would like you to be part of it. I hope to receive your feedback, so I can bring this project forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you very much!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can register at: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://moj.projectace.net/\"\u003ehttp://moj.projectace.net/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["social","network","programming","online judge"]}}
