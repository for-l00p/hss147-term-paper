Pre-requisite for this video is one-dimensional segment tree. I have tried to explain things as easy as possible. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dkKlZ9B3cS14\"\u003e2D segment tree video tutorial\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ewe have attached code in description.(it\u0027s not full version in initial steps, because, we want you to try, functions that we have mentioned in code. I am sure, if you watch video 2-3 times, you will surely be able to implement 2D segment tree by yourself. ) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGood Luck and Have Fun.
