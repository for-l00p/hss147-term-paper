Today I wanted to find: how often I used some functions or keywords in my all accepted submissions, what is the time when I used some first, and other information. It would be easier to do, if I have all submissions in my PC, because then I could easily \u0027grep\u0027 such info. And if someone downloads his submissions, he could store them in his own database, and add his own marks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["download"]}}
