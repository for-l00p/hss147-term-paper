However, the problem should also have some solution with 2D segtrees that can easily copy-paste a segment tree of fenwick tree\u0027s code (2D segment trees on sums, for instance), resulting in shorter coding time should you have the code ready. The segtree solution can be complete overkill, but as long as it takes less time to code (given the tree code) than another common solution, the problem is great.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/w4/challenges/crush\"\u003eAlgorithmic Crush\u003c/a\u003e is a great example of a problem that has a simple \u003ca href\u003d\"http://chasethered.com/tag/sorting/\"\u003esolution without segtrees\u003c/a\u003e (scroll down to this problem), but a shorter solution with a 1D segtree, provided youve coded it before and only need a few tweaks.
