So if a computer alternates color of text against black (important) background, you can have some exercise for eyes at the same time while you\u0027re shitposting. (You also might want to add something non-readable of opposite color (to text) so total light flux remains the same; I think boxes around letters, or text underline would be good. I also tried a method where one color channel is blurred and the other is sharp, but the result looks very bad)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI implement a sample in a QtWebkit, but many sites don\u0027t work well in that minimal browser.
