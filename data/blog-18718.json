I used a modified\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDFS to do that — \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/510/submission/11664540\" title\u003d\"Submission 11664540 by sidchelseafan\"\u003e11664540\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI do a DFS to check for a cycle, then I do a topological sort on the DAG if there are no cycles. But I was getting \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWA 12th case. I tried reading others\u0027 solutions but couldn\u0027t find what was wrong with my code. I then used an O(V^2) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003etopological sort and it passed. Can someone point my mistake.
