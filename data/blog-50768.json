While there\u0027s a huge number of online contests nowadays, participation in most of them doesn\u0027t give any perks except T-shirts and (sometimes) money for top finishers. While onsite contest, even if it only rewards top finishers with the money, is a good reward itself and promotion to the onsite contest is a great motivation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, everybody is aware of such well-known contests with onsite finals as Topcoder Open, Facebook Hackercup, Google Code Jam. There\u0027re also some marathon contests such as Marathon24, Deadline24, Challenge24. But there\u0027re more contests than that â€” for example, Codechef Snackdown (started last year), VK Cup, CROC (only for Russian-speaking participants), Mindcoding (\u003ca\u003ehttps://mindcoding.ro/)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTherefore I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027re some other contests that I\u0027m not aware of. If there\u0027s no such list, let\u0027s create one! What do you think about this idea?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["onsite","final"]}}
