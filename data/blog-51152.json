As usual, there are many interesting insights from the survey. For example, 22% of developers do learn from coding competitions. Full results can be seen here:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://stackoverflow.com/insights/survey/2017/\"\u003eStack Overflow Developer Survey Result 2017\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, I am wondering whether Codeforces or any other platform ever conduct similar survey, but specific for competitive programming. I think it will be great if we get the insight about what topics competitive programmers love the most or afraid the most, what languages they prefer, average training time per week, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease share if you know any survey about this, or whether it is possible for Codeforces to conduct one. :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["survey"]}}
