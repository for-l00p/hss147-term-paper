Some squares contain obstacles, except the left- and right-most columns which are obstacle-free. The left-most column is filled with your \u003cstrong\u003en\u003c/strong\u003e pieces, 1 per row. Your goal is to \u003cstrong\u003emove all your pieces to the right-most column\u003c/strong\u003e as quickly as possible. In a given turn, you can move each piece N, S, E, or W one space, or leave that piece in place. A piece cannot move onto a square containing an obstacle, nor may two pieces move to the same square on the same turn. All pieces move simultaneously, so one may move to a location currently occupied by another piece so long as that piece itself moves elsewhere at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003en\u0026lt;\u003d25\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eany help will be appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["graphs","shortest path"]}}
