This the the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ideone.com/zCpfga\"\u003ecode\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn my local machine, the value of pre[0][0], automatically becomes 1 randomly anywhere inside the while loop. However, the weird thing is, if I initialise the value of fact[0] to 0, then everything becomes normal again. This is weird because the computation of fact has nothing to do with the value of pre[0][0].\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI feel silly asking this, but what am I missing? The code which is giving wrong answer on the local machine , gives the correct answer on Ideone, and also fetches full marks after submission.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan someone please help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks. Peace. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
