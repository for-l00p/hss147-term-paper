Suppose I want to practice the D problems of all recent contests or any particular problem of some contest. So whenever I would open the problem, the tags would be visible to me which I don\u0027t want because I want to think about the problem from scratch. The only solution I saw was to make it a virtual contest and then do the problem. But this also has downsides because maybe I would like to read the problem now and then open it again tomorrow for some clarification. Then I would have to start a virtual contest each time I want to view the problem. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow I use the \u0026quot;Complete problemset\u0026quot; link located below the problems on the right side (wonder why I didn\u0027t notice this earlier) which enables me to view all problems without constantly trying to not look at the tags. I hope this helps people facing a similar problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEdit: \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-violet\" href\u003d\"/profile/Schullz\" title\u003d\"Candidate Master Schullz\"\u003eSchullz\u003c/a\u003e has given an even better solution: Go to your profile -\u0026gt; \u0026quot;Change settings\u0026quot; -\u0026gt; \u0026quot;Show tags for unsolved problems\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["practice","problemtags"]}}
