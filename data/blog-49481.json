I tried to solve this problem by doing the following: 1. Since the answer is bound to come in 60 steps. If I calculate the minimum moves to reach the answer then I am done. 2. so I thought First try, anew \u003d a+b and ask for solution (anew,b,n-anew), and then try bnew \u003d a+b and ask for solution of (a,bnew,n-bnew) . Then I will store the solution whichever gives me minimum steps; 3.Since three elements are forming the state of DP memoizing becomes messy and difficult to construct the actual solution. 4. I tried hard to implement but could not pass even simple test case 5. I also found it difficult to write base cases for recursion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wish to know how you approach such DP problems? If there are other solutions to the problem, I would be happy to know their approaches too. Please help me with this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#dp"]}}
