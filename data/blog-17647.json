Basically, they will get a chance to compete in both D2 and D1 contests (though in D2 they will be separated from everyone else)? Looking at a couple of the most recent D2 contests, it appears that most of violet users actually solve 3 problems or less (in a 5 problem contest), which means it will still be a good competition for them. The only problem I can see with this is that you can become yellow without participating in a single D1 contest, but this doesn\u0027t seem to be so horrible if more people can write more contests as official participants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["nobody reads tags"]}}
