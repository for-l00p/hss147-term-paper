Label that node T. Run another BFS to find the farthest node from T. The path you found in step 2 is the longest path in the tree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut my problem is that it is becoming really very difficult to implement what is asked.Can anybody show me the code what is asked.Preferably in C++ and using dfs.Thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["longest path","c++"]}}
