Recently I came back as a competitor and I participated in four SRMs. Here are my performances:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSRM 681 Hard: CoinFlips\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was an easy DP, but I started to implement something stupid and wasted time. When I finished coding around 5 minutes before the end of the contest, the server was slow and I couldn\u0027t compile my solution. Though the match was unrated, I should have solved it earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSRM 682 Hard: TheKFactor\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy solution failed because of precision errors (in Linear Programming). I should have used long doubles instead of doubles (and passed in the practice room).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSRM 683 Hard: RandomWalkOnGrid\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eFailed systest because of two (!) stupid mistakes: incorrect array size and integer overflow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSRM 684 Hard: Permutant\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eMissed cases with a.size() \u003d\u003d 1.
