One of the teams was called \u003cem\u003eRunners\u003c/em\u003e and the other was \u003cem\u003eRunners VKCup\u003c/em\u003e. You see, nothing suspicious on first glance. So these teams used the same codes to pass A\u0027s pretests but me and my friend Radoslav hacked them both â€” \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/771/submission/25610569\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/771/submission/25620646\"\u003e2\u003c/a\u003e :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the end, one of these teams managed to accept A for 75 points. I would normally ask for making their round unrated but they actually lost rating so this sounds like a better punishment :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["cheaters","funk you","karma"]}}
