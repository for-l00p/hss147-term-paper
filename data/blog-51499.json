Which is: If we want to find P is S, then we calculate value of Z[] array using the string P + $(or any unused sign) + S. Then for any i, if Z[i] \u003d\u003d |P|, then we state that P is found in S.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, I want to know other applications of Z algorithm. Please tell me what other kinds of problems we can solve using Z algorithm and how ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["z algorithm","string","string algorithms","pattern_matching"]}}
