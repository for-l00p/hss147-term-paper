Thanks a ton for that. For past 4-5 weekends I have been learning Android and working on the Android version of the same app. This version will be able to display live and upcoming contests from various competitive programming websites, and will provide links to the contests. I haven\u0027t been able to make the UI as sleek as I wanted, animations are missing and notification system isn\u0027t built yet. But I\u0027ll be doing that over next couple of weekends. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAppSite : \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.star-lord.me/CodeHorizon/\"\u003ehttp://www.star-lord.me/CodeHorizon/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eITunes : \u003ca href\u003d\"https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/codehorizon/id925056167?mt\u003d8\"\u003ehttps://itunes.apple.com/in/app/codehorizon/id925056167?mt\u003d8\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoogle Play Store : \u003ca href\u003d\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id\u003dcom.chintanghate.CodeHorizon\"\u003ehttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id\u003dcom.chintanghate.CodeHorizon\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet me know what you think about the app. If you spot any bugs or have any improvements in mind, suggestions are more than welcome.
