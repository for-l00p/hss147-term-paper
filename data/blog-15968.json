However I think this one seem appeared in a round of Codeforces, I don\u0027t probably remember.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven 2 strings with bit 0/1. String 1 has n bits, string 2 has m bits (n, m \u0026lt;\u003d 10^5). There are at most 10000 queries, each contains 4 number a, b, c, d (condition is b-a\u003dd-c). For each query, output one only number- numbers of bit 1 in the result when taking (segment [a,b] of string 1) OR (segment [c,d] of string 2).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eExample:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003en\u003d 4, m\u003d 5\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eString 1: 0011\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eString 2: 10101\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQueries:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ea\u003d 2, b\u003d 3, c\u003d 1, d\u003d 2 ----\u0026gt; answer is 2 because (01 | 10) \u003d 11 which has 2 bit 1\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ea\u003d 2, b\u003d 4, c\u003d 2, d\u003d 4 ----\u0026gt; answer is 2 because (011 | 010) \u003d 011 which has 2 bit 1\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you for reading!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
