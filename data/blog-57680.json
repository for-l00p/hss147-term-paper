At last we got stuck in these two problems. Turns out, the Editorial is not out yet. So i was hoping to discuss these two problems here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Simple Polygon \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.codechef.com/problems/SIMPPOLY\"\u003ehttps://www.codechef.com/problems/SIMPPOLY\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eand\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSliding Puzzle \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.codechef.com/problems/AMPUZZLE\"\u003ehttps://www.codechef.com/problems/AMPUZZLE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the \u0026quot;A Simple Polygon\u0026quot; we were thinking of doing a Delaunay Triangulation in nlog(n) and printing out 500 diagonals from it. But i dunno, Maybe, that is an overkill for this problem. Also is there any good implementation of Delaunay Triangulation in nlog(n) out there, which is worth putting in my notebook?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny sort of help is appreciated.
