I understand that segment trees have to be built for all ranges in an array, and we can condense the memory and runtime by adding on to a segment tree, but I don\u0027t understand how to do that. If you have a segment tree that is already built, and want to add log(n) nodes, wouldn\u0027t you have to copy the entire segment tree over again, and then add the log(n) nodes? Could someone please clarify this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance, memset123\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["segment tree"]}}
