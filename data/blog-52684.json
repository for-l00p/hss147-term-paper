Ivan thinks that a positive integer number x is really big if the difference between x and the sum of its digits (in decimal representation) is not less than s. To prove that these numbers may have different special properties, he wants to know how rare (or not rare) they are â€” in fact, he needs to calculate the quantity of really big numbers that are not greater than n.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIvan tried to do the calculations himself, but soon realized that it\u0027s too difficult for him.
