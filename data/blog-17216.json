Some days ago something happened: since then I can\u0027t see submissions, see anybody\u0027s rating graphs, can\u0027t write comments, vote, can\u0027t write private messages. Isn\u0027t that only for me? I can\u0027t write pm to admin :/ , and didn\u0027t find any other contact [upd: I wrote to email, have thought about it later]. Sorry, if there are more folks with that problem and simply you can\u0027t respond.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["bugs","add-on","adblock"]}}
