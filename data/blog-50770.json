But first I used a O(m*n*lgn) solution \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/779/submission/25157768\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e (for m\u003d1000 and n\u003d5000, which is ~6*10^7) that got TLE. I used map in this one which made it slower. Then I tried using map only in the beggining instead of using all the way in the code (as shown \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/779/submission/25157769\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e). This means that first I mapped the string to the index that gives the element that the map would represent. Accessing the element this way is O(1), therefore the solution was O(m*n) which got accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut shouldnt the 3 second limit be enough for less the 10^8 operations in the first solution? I though that 1 second meant 10^9 operations. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSorry for the begginer\u0027s doubt. Possibly it\u0027s because I used many operations per iteration, but how should I know? what do you consider as the boundary, 10^7 per second? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePS: actually in the first solution the map is deleted and remade in every iteration, which means that its size is not always the maximun n, which is actually faster than what I considered in this post.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
