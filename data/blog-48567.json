Solution of all of this problems are the same. You just need to know how to solve one of them. Example : You need to perform some queries on an array a1, a2, ...a, n. Each query give you numbers l, r and v and for each i such that l ≤ i ≤ r you should increase ai by v, and then after performing all queries, you should print the whole array. Solution : You should have another array p1, p2, ..., pn which, all of its members are initially 0, for each query, you should increase pl by v and decrease pr + 1 by v . An then, for each i, starting from 1 you should increase pi by pi - 1. So, final array would be a1 + p1, a2 + p2, ..., an + pn .
