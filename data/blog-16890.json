Today competitive programmers certainly have a lot of online resources to practice. Nevertheless, there are so many problems out there, that it\u0027s hard to find some \u0026quot;valuable\u0026quot; problem sometimes. By \u0026quot;valuable\u0026quot;, I mean a problem that is not just some repeated-idea problem or some problem that the participant already encountered before, or maybe just some problem that provides no new knowledge or it\u0027s too long/boring to be worthy to practice, since you will expend more time reading/understanding/coding the problem in relation to what you really learn from it. So, I would like everyone interested to post a small (or big?) list of problems that he/she considers VERY valuable so far in his/her practice so far. If people like the idea, we can later collect this information and compile some nice list of \u0026quot;The Most Valuable Practice Problems\u0026quot; or something similar. Thanks for reading and looking forward to hear the opinion from the community!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["problem","practice"]}}
