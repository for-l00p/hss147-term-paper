I saw a lot of posts about them but I can\u0027t decide which approach is better. I know the recursive method but I didn\u0027t try to implement lazy propagation on that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I finally decided to search on google the lazy propagation method, I found that there is another well known approach, the array without recursion. I found it on these links:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/3327\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/blog/entry/3327\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/18051\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/blog/entry/18051\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ebut I didn\u0027t implemented them because I thought it\u0027s useless if I learn the recursive segtree. It was pretty hard to find a recursive tutorial on segtree(this is the one I found: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.hackerearth.com/notes/segment-tree-and-lazy-propagation/\"\u003ehttps://www.hackerearth.com/notes/segment-tree-and-lazy-propagation/\u003c/a\u003e ) and that made me write to you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think is the best approach, and what\u0027s the most popular? I want to learn the one that\u0027s better on long run, and the one that\u0027s easy to code when it comes to 2D segtree. Thanks a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["data structure","segment tree"]}}
