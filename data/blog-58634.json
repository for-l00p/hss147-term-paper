In specific, would the previous silver division or gold division have problems of the same difficulty as current gold? Would past years silver problems be more beneficial to solve, or would previous years\u0027 gold problems be more ideal to prepare for the current USACO gold? \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eDynamic Programming and Contest Prep\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso as a side note, could someone provide links/resources to learn dynamic programming (dp) because that is my weak point. I understand the nature of dynamic programming problems, however, I often struggle to come up with a solution that builds off the optimal substructure. Additionally, what else would one recommend to perform well in USACO gold contests, apart from learning algorithms and practicing previous USACO problems?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for all the help!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dynamic programming","usaco","dp","#advice","train","training camp","#dynamic-programming","2d-dp","3-d dp","classical problems","problem solving"]}}
