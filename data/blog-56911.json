But there are also a same problem on UVa online judge . . \u003ca href\u003d\"https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/101/10181.pdf\"\u003ehttps://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/101/10181.pdf\u003c/a\u003e . It\u0027s time limit is 15.00 seconds. I can solve this in .750 second. . But in lightoj time complexity is very tight so I am getting TLE everytime. . I have used manhatton distance here as heuristic. . My code for Lightoj problem is . \u003ca href\u003d\"https://pastebin.com/QSCXhSMp\"\u003ehttps://pastebin.com/QSCXhSMp\u003c/a\u003e . I have also tried manhatton distance with linear conflict as heuristic but could not get accepted !! Where is the problem?? I think on lightoj there are many(100) test cases . So i need to optimize it . How to optimize ?? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
