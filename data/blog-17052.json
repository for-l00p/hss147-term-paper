Can someone shed some light on that mysterious mirror? It\u0027s in the schedule but there are no other informations in English CF... How it will be conducted, like a normal CF round or some ACM style contest? Can anyone knowing more than I share his knowledge? I guess that this round won\u0027t follow typical CF round, so it would be great to know something more and I suppose that our russian colleagues know pretty much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.S. When registering I got to know that it will be rated, but before that I didn\u0027t know even this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["vk","cup"]}}
