Today we decided to share it with Codeforces community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the ease of use of Algos, all algorithms (with very rare exceptions) can be compiled and executed as is. Moreover, in order to verify the correctness of code and to help understanding the purpose of algorithm, the source code of every algorithm is based on some reference problem (on which the link is provided). Short description and time complexity are also available for every algorithm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlgos is originally based on the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://github.com/ADJA/algos\"\u003erepository on Github\u003c/a\u003e.
