I was feeling very enthusiastic about all of these fabulous talks, so I decided to look on Youtube for an address speech of Mark Zuckerberg. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI clicked on the first video which was \u0026quot;Mark Zuckerberg speech to 8th graders.\u0026quot; Clearly, the 8th graders were talking to each other, not caring much about Mark, and the speaker introduced him as \u0026quot;Mark ZuckerMan.\u0026quot; All of these while Mark had an expression of \u0026quot;How did I get here?\u0026quot; \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOh Mark, what happened? At least you got your address speech :P\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLink to video: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dc5m2f4bGtDg\"\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dc5m2f4bGtDg\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
