What do you think about it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are N vertices and at most N directed edges. Some vertices don\u0027t have any edge connecting itself with some other vertex; some have only one. Every vertex has some value assigned to itself (A_i is the value of ith vertex). We can use any edge to move other vertices from the current vertex. We can use even edges that are incoming, but incoming edges cost 1 point, whereas outgoing edges cost nothing. What is the maximum sum of values of vertices that can be traversed when we start at vertex u with K points?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1 \u0026lt;\u003d N \u0026lt;\u003d 1,000\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1 \u0026lt;\u003d K \u0026lt;\u003d 100\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1 \u0026lt;\u003d A_i \u0026lt;\u003d 10,000\u003c/p\u003e \u003chr /\u003e\u003cp\u003eUPD.
