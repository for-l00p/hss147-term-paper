The actual USACO question is much easier (I think). \u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe question\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s suppose that we have a game played as follows: \u003cbr /\u003e In the beginning, we have two arrays V and W, both of size n. W is filled with some colors (the colors are represented as numbers from 1 to 100000000) and V is a blank array (all the cells have zero as color). We play in rounds, and at each round we can choose for every color at most one segment [L, R] and paint all of V\u0027s cells from L to R with the given color. In a round, we can only choose for every color at most one segment, and all choosen segments need to be disjoint. We need to print the minimum number of rounds need to transform V into W.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSample Input: \u003cbr /\u003e 8 (The value of N) \u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e 3 4 3 7 3 2 2 4 (the array W)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSample Output : \u003cbr /\u003e 2 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eExplanation: In the first round we can paint the segment [0,4] with the color 3 , the segment [5,6] with the color 2 and the segment [7,7] with the color 4.
