Yes, we had several testers, we had a bruteforce solution that worked correctly, we had a stress testing between the bruteforce and the main solutions. However, all these measures haven\u0027t prevented the mistake: the testers haven\u0027t noted the issue, the stress haven\u0027t found any counter-tests. The solutions also produced the same answers all small tests we had in the testset, so we only found the issue when a test used for a hack was added.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are terribly sorry about the mistake. We did our best to ensure the problems are ok, I don\u0027t know any available method that we haven\u0027t used to check the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ve spent the last few hours trying to come up with a new, correct solution to the problem, but right now I don\u0027t see any solution that seems undoubtedly correct to me. There are a few that work better than the author\u0027s, but yet unproved, you can try to prove \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/52927?#comment-369909\"\u003ethis one\u003c/a\u003e, for example. I think this problem should be solvable with careful case analysis, and I\u0027m trying to do this right now. I\u0027ll post the results here. I\u0027d also be glad if someone post the solution with proof.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThus, I apologize that the round should be declared unrated. Hope for your understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
