I vaguely remember pulling up someone\u0027s code a while back that used a recursive DFS with input size at least 100,000. I also have Steven and Felix Halim\u0027s Competitive Programming book and they seem to use recursion without regard to the possibility of stack overflow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
