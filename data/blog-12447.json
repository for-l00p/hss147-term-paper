However, I\u0027m warping my mind around it and I\u0027m not still sure of how to solve it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would like to try to solve some basic vertex cover problems first and try to approach this later. Does anyone know a good problem from any online judge to recommend?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(I\u0027m talking about the NP-Complete vertex cover on small instances, not vertex cover on bipartite graphs, trees, etc)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["nwerc","vertex cover","graph"]}}
