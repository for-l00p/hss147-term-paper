As a beginning i have written editorial for two questions: one problem is from Hackerrank\u0027s \u0026quot;zenhacks\u0026quot; contest â€” Find maximum index product and the other problem is from Timus online judge. I have posted them in my blog (link can be found below). I would like to know how far it is good and hence i request you people to have a look at it and give me some feedback ( both positives and negatives are welcome ).
