The code is messy but you can see it \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/gym/100482/submission/17555856\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the contest I went to look for other people solutions and most of them seem to have solved using determinant, but not for calculate the area of the 2 triangles like me, it\u0027s like given the four points of the quadrilateral a, b, c and d, the area is 1/2 * (det(a,b) + det(b,c) + det(c,d) + det(d,a)), but I have no idea why this is true.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf someone can explain this relation, or point me to some place that explains it I would be very thankfull! :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
