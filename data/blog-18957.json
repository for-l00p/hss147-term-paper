Today i want to share with you my little achievement, from less than 5 minutes i got my 200 Green light, averaging almost two problems per day, you can say good, knowing that the last two month i was so busy in collogue exams and tests, but it\u0027s not enough for me. I will keep on the hard work, especially after i finish my exams, and try to reach 1000 Green light so i could be 200% ready for the ACM-ICPC 2016-2017 !!! and to all contestants, Wish you all the best...
