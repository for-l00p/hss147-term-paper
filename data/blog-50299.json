Do bfs and dfs algorithms over this graph. You may be surprised but the spanning tree formed by BFS algorithm looks like a sun so I called this tree \u0026quot;Solnyshko-tree\u0026quot; while the tree formed by DFS algorithms looks like a line so I called it \u0026quot;Bamboooo-tree\u0026quot;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a better understanding I suggest you to have a look at provided pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/f8/af/f8afb0a74ba5b1e3cec99adb39c866275abe3be4.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/1a/b0/1ab0d6dbad8f3eaa2b2ceacc9631269d6a8ebfc2.png\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHope you find this topic interesting and useful.
