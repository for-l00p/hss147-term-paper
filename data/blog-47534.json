Stated in a different way, what is the probability that a randomly chosen system of n equation in 2 variables yields a result.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollow up — does this probability equals the probability of n random planes intersecting at a point in 3-D space ? more generally, does this equal to the probability of n random N-dimension \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane\"\u003ehyperplanes\u003c/a\u003e intersecting at a point in N-D space ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI did googled things, but i found this question stacked with some constraint on space, for example, in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1155794/probability-of-intersection-of-line-segments\"\u003eTHIS\u003c/a\u003e the space is constrained to a circle and in \u003ca href\u003d\"https://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid\u003d20090113154110AAl4x7a\"\u003eTHIS\u003c/a\u003e the spaces is a 3-D grid. these made me thing whether there exist something for general case or not.
