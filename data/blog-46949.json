There was a question -- (\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.codechef.com/INSQ2016/problems/INSQ16C\"\u003ehttps://www.codechef.com/INSQ2016/problems/INSQ16C\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt basically gives a complete binary tree and q queries and in the worst case you would have to traverse the complete binary tree q times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy question is what is the time complexity to traverse a complete binary tree with n nodes, is it O(n) ( because there are n nodes to visit) or is it O(logn) because the height of that tree is logn.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe constraint on number of nodes is 10^5 and number of queries is 10^5 as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy solution which is basically( queries * time for tree traversal) passes in the given time.But I want to ask, is it because of weak test cases(which I suspect, is really the case!) or was it really correct?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy solution â€” (\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/11367435\"\u003ehttps://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/11367435\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan anybody clear this up for me?Thanks\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
