My idea is : 1. if length of string in less than 26 , print \u0026quot;-1\u0026quot; and return ; 2. calculate frequency of first 26 characters and then see how many characters are left out and how many \u0027?\u0027 are available . 3. If left out \u003d\u003d cnt[\u0027?\u0027] it is possible. 4. If not go for next 26. 4. I tried it but failed on 18th test case \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/716/submission/23468918\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e? Could you help me with my implementation.
