It seems like an straightfoward Kruskal implementation to me. At first, I was using a vector to store all the edges, but that resulted in MLE in testcase 21. Only then I came to realize N could be upto 10^4, and there\u0027s no way to store 10^4 * 10^4 edges without getting a MLE veredict.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs there an heuristic or data structure to quickly calculate the minimum distance between all the points and generate the MST of the given graph?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["graphs","kruskal","gym"]}}
