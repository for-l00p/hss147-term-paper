After many failed attempts I peeked at the AC solutions.I found a very interesting thing.\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/319/submission/20785092\"\u003e This\u003c/a\u003e gets AC. However, if I replace the explicit conversion to double, with an explicit conversion to long long (which seems more suitable in this case, since we\u0027re not dealing with floating point numbers) I get WA, like \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/319/submission/20785181\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e. Now, forgive me if it is a dumb question but I really didn\u0027t come across something like this before. Can someody help me figure it out?
