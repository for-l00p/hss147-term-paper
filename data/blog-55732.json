For Technocup, results of this round will be counted for elimination. Also, we plan to hold one more (the fourth) elimination round to compensate this failure. Stay tuned for updates. We apologize for the situation, hope you enjoyed the problems.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHello.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you are upset about today round, I understand you. Please, downvote this blog instead of the official announcement. The coordinator, writers and tester did a great job making the round. But technical issues erased their effort.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe chain of technical issues leaded to so bad work of the website. This week our server with Polygon system had broken and Mail.Ru quckly replaced it with another one. I forgot to reconfigure Polygon on the new server and it leaded to 502 during the contest. Also today one Codeforces server stopped to respond and I do not know the reason yet (it is first time issue with this server).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRight now I feel myself very upset and thinking about the way to change an approach to have enough time to setup, monitor and develop the system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSorry again about it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
