There is something about the thrill of working and competing to improve one\u0027s rating in an online community, that helps motivate all of us to improve. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m wondering if, theoretically, it could be possible to recreate this experience in the high-school classroom. Currently, students see schoolwork as a burden; one funny quote I\u0027ve heard is to \u0026quot;not let school get in the way of learning\u0026quot;. If somehow students could learn subjects such as math, physics, or anything else in an online community through training for competitions and rating, perhaps this could make learning more fun and exciting? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eObviously I think it would be a bad idea to grade based on rating; that would only create unhealthy competition. Perhaps something such as this could replace traditional homework? I\u0027m curious as to what you all think.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
