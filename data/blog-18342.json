Then using that info I update the new score by calculating the difference in score after a beer is placed or removed. The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would appreciate it if anyone can figure out what\u0027s going on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
