Is there any practical and simple method that I can do this task? (I can only do some input-output programming task,for example ,given an array and give back the sorted array.But I wonder how to solve a practical programming task like this :) . Is it a much different concept of programming?)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
