I know that there are other(faster) ways to implement segment tree as needed for RMQ, but I wanted to implement it with standard(check my code for what I call standard) implementation of 2D seg tree. Unfortunately, I got TL on test 16. So I wanted to ask whether there is some way to optimise my solution(without using the other faster way to implement segment tree).
