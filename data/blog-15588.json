In one operation, you can add 1 to any element of your choice. What is the minimum number of operations needed so that the absolute value in difference between all consecutive elements is less than or equal to a given positive integer, K. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI will give a sample test:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are 3 positive integers, {1,4,2} and K\u003d2. Here, only one operation will be needed, to add 1 to the first element. Then, we will have the array {2,4,2}, which has absolute value in difference between all consecutive integers less than or equal to 2. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoes anyone have any ideas how to solve this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance, memset123\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["algorithms"]}}
