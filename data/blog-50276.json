My idea is I will pre-process _hash array with the hash values and afterwards I will just extract hashes of all the k-length strings and keep that in a map. Afterwards, I just output the size of the map. Any help to identify my mistake is really appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["hashing","spoj"]}}
