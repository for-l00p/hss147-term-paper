For this purpose I use Codeforces Gym and prepare the problems in Polygon. The trouble comes from the fact that not all of the competitions provide model solutions. Most of them give the test data, but it is in the form of input-output files and from what I\u0027ve managed to understand â€” Polygon wants a model solution to generate output files.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy question is : Is there a way to prepare a problem in Polygon by manually uploading the correct outputs of the tests and having no model solution?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
