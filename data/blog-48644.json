All implementations I have seen only support finding aggregates of vertices along such paths, and I think that simply having each vertex store the value of the edge from it to its parent doesn\u0027t work well when one links vertices which changes the parents of a bunch of vertices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
