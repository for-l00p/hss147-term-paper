And also for the given multiple sink, form a new sink whose edge\u0027s weight is the capacity of the given (multiple) sinks. My default source and sink is 0 and 250. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn case of a node which is not source or sink, I connect a new node with that given node( adding 120 ) having a edge weights the capacity of the given node.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I run Flow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/yBO69l\"\u003eMy code\u003c/a\u003e gives Runtime error.
