Each query can be one of the following types: 1) 1 x y: make edge between point x and y. 2) 2 x y: Find distance between x and y (number of edges in the path from x to y). 3) 3 x: Number of nodes of the component in which node x resides. It is guaranteed that after making edge between x and y, tree structure will be as it is i.e. there will be no query such that it makes a cycle. Constarints: 1 \u0026lt;\u003d N,Q \u0026lt;\u003d 100000 I know that we can join x and y and make an edge by Disjoint Set Union technique. By using that, we can also store number of nodes in each component. But I don\u0027t know how to solve query (2). Can anybody help?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#trees","disjoint set","disjoint-set","#tree","distance","#union-find","#unionfind"]}}
