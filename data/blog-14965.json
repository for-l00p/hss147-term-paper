Here is the link:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/dynamic-programming-classics-the-longest-common-subsequence\"\u003ehttps://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/dynamic-programming-classics-the-longest-common-subsequence\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince the test data is so weak, the traditional O(mn) solution can pass all the test data. So let\u0027s assume the two strings can be as long as 10^5. In this case, how to solve this problem? I guess the time complexity of the solution should be O(500*10^5) but have no idea to code it ... :-(\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dynamic programming","hackerrank"]}}
