Then I saw this solution to the problem \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/452/submission/7280377\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/452/submission/7280377\u003c/a\u003e .  What I could get from his solution is, it is assumed that the middle value and one of the numbers a or b is within a range of 5. Could someone please explain how this approach works and its proof. Also correct me if my assumption about his solution is wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["permuation","math"]}}
