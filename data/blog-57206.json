We had built the original version last year with a great idea i.e. codeforces ratings of users are used to put them in one of the 5 levels. Now suppose you are level 3 user and you want your code reviewed then a member a level above you i.e. level 4 would review your code. However if you want your next code reviewed you have to first review the code of a member a level below you i.e. level 2. So everyone is benefitted. But the work on platform was stopped due to some reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow as the entire codebase is open-sourced, you all can start contributing and work on the features that you want. All details regarding the file structures, database diagrams, page linkage description and contribution guide is available on \u003ca href\u003d\"https://github.com/iammangod96/codereview\"\u003ehttps://github.com/iammangod96/codereview\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease contribute and help to make this platform bigger and better.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMANISH SHARMA\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCodeReview | \u003ca href\u003d\"http://codereview.orgfree.com\"\u003ecodereview.orgfree.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#platform","#coding","#website"]}}
