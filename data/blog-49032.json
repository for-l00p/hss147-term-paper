And is it always true in all the online judges or do we need to initialize it with zero to eliminate the random values ? For eg when i write the following :\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eint a[10];\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003efor(int i \u003d 0; i \u0026lt; 10; ++i) cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; a[i] \u0026lt;\u0026lt; endl;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI get random values and sometimes zero. Could anyone tell me what is exactly happening. Thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["doubt","array","help"]}}
