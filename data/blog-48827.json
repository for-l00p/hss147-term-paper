Can you please explain ? My logic is : I am leveling the graph , using adjacent of X as a source node . If i got \u003cstrong\u003ea odd level node and this node has no adjacent node\u003c/strong\u003e Gobu wins , if for all possible there has no node such that \u003cstrong\u003eodd level node and this node has no adjacent node\u003c/strong\u003e i am printing gobu cant win .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy code: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://pastebin.com/QcexBD3K\"\u003eCode\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
