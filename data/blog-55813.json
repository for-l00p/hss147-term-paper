But my confusion is on complexity. Is it possible to solve this on polynomial time?? because, if there are n odd vertices , then they can be paired (n-1)*(n-3)*(n-5)*.....1 So , to generate all possible pairing we need massive time if n is big. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, My first question is , Is it possible to calculate pairing with any algorithm in polynomial time??\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, Is there another approach where pairing is not needed and can be solved on polynomial time??\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease answer. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["chinese_postman"]}}
