I encountered a problem at work. I have to search from 1000000 strings that are built from only 0\u0027s and 1\u0027s if any of them is at least %80 percent similar to an arbitrarily given string. By similarity I mean hamming distance. The thing is linear searching is no good enough to make it in at least 0.2 seconds. All strings are of the same length which is 64 characters. Any help or suggestion is welcome, have a nice day!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["hamming","searching"]}}
