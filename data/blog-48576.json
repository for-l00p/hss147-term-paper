As far as I can tell my algorithm is the same as the one in the tutorial and it\u0027s implemented in C++ so I\u0027m at a loss for why it\u0027s not fast enough. Moreover when I change from reading in the input to automatically generating an input the same size it takes 13ms and the question allows 1000ms/1s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn practise I\u0027m reading through the rows of a 1000x1000 matrix one at a time and then the columns one at a time. In my head this should be about 2 million operations (I\u0027ve heard 10^9 is usually the upper limit to avoid).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy code is here \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/738/submission/22423987\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/738/submission/22423987\u003c/a\u003e. Any help would be greatly appreciated. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJon\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.S. It seems like my code is coming out without any kind of spacing. How do I correct this? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["beginner"]}}
