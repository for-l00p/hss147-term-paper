My initial solution got a time limit exceeded on test case 53, so I tried to optimize it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo optimize, I made a couple of changes to my check() function, that is called every time the Mo\u0027s Algorithm window is slid 1 tree node. I was thinking that this would make the algorithm run faster since check is the part that is run the most (n^1.5 lg n times). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy second submission didn\u0027t end up working. In fact, somehow, my new submission got TLE on test case 5, which the previous code could solve in 150ms! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan someone help me figure out what could\u0027ve happened that would make this attempted optimization run 10x slower?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOriginal Submission: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/375/submission/18813131\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/375/submission/18813131\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond Submission: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/375/submission/18813311\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/375/submission/18813311\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDiff: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.diffchecker.com/nhyeayxp\"\u003ehttps://www.diffchecker.com/nhyeayxp\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you very much!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["mo","tree","inorder","fenwick"]}}
