I coded the offline solution, but i was wondering how to solve it using persisent segment trees.I kept an array last_occur[i] which stores the latest occurence of the number i. now given a range (l,r) we need to find number of distinct elements with last_occur[i] \u0026lt; l.I got stuck here, how do we solve this part?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["persistent segment tree","d-query"]}}
