From this I understood that when k \u003d 0, s would necessarly be \u0027-\u0027, but I then submitted this \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ideone.com/bYZfIo\"\u003ecode\u003c/a\u003e, identical to the AC one, with one exception: if s \u003d \u0027+\u0027 and k \u003d 0, then it would give TLE, which indeed happend but shouldn\u0027t. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDid I misinterpeted the statement or is the problem indeed wrong?
