The thing is that there is a mistake (or I can not understand what they mean). They talk about a function SOD(x), which is Sum Of Divisors of x. But the SOD of 12, for example, clearly isn\u0027t 3, as they say in the pdf.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope someone can give me a hand with it, and if you have some extra topics I can read about, that might help me with this problem, would be great as well!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["swerc","math","primes","factorisation","lcm"]}}
