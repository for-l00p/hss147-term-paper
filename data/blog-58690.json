Like the first round, it will last for 7 days. There is one task which does not have the complete solution that can be found in a few seconds, but you can try different approaches to score as many points as possible. According to the results of the two rounds (see section 3 in \u003ca href\u003d\"https://contest.yandex.com/algorithm2018/rules/\"\u003ehttps://contest.yandex.com/algorithm2018/rules/\u003c/a\u003e — rules of combining results are the same for algorithmic and optimization tracks) we will determine the winners of the Optimization track and 128 future owners of the t-shirts with the logo of the competition. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have prepared for you a task that simulates the web crawling performed by the search robot. We offer you to experience the complexity of indexing sites and try to optimize the crawling of the Internet — this is just one of the problems that software engineer solve at Yandex. Of course, the task was quite simplified, because you have only a week to solve it, but can you come up with good solution how to assign sites to robots optimally?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegistration for the contest is still open, so you can join at any time — good luck!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["yandex.contest","yandex.algorithm","marathon"]}}
