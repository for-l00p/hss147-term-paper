When I solve some problems in a gym contest (without coach mode), open the coach mode and then view any submission in the contest, all my solutions disappear from standings, status and from my submissions. And I have to open the coach mode to find them in the standings. Also the problems are marked as unsolved (They are not green anymore) and this particularly is really annoying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDid anybody notice this issue before? And is it a bug or this is intended to happen? I hope it\u0027s a bug :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["gym","bug"]}}
