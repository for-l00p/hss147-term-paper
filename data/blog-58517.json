However, being lazy, Bessie decides to skip K checkpoints where K \u0026lt; N (She cannot skip the first and last checkpoints as well). We must find the minimum distance Bessie is required to run by skipping K checkpoints. In this case, the distances are computed as Manhattan distances where the distance from x to y would be represented as: |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion:\u003c/strong\u003e The issue is I am having trouble wrapping my head around the dynamic programming solution (linked above). Could someone provide a through explanation of the steps in discovering such a dynamic programming solution as well?
