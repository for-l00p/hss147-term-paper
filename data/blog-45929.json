Example: Let\u0027s take a polynomial of degree 3 -\u0026gt; 3x^3+ x^2 + 9 We are given many value of \u0027x\u0027 and a coefficient vector like [3,1,0,9] and let\u0027s take \u0027x\u0027 take to be 3 then it will be evaluated as 3*3^3 + 3^2 + 9 \u003d 81+9+9 \u003d 99 so the answer will be 99. Let\u0027s say we have q queries so Horner\u0027s rule will take O(nq). Is there any better algorithm? I have heard about FFT and DFT and I have consulted many resources but all in vain. Can anyone help me to understand it please?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["math","fft","advanced math","polynomials"]}}
