If that\u0027s the case, what would be a formal proof for that? I believe this property would be crucial to solve this problem: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/problemset/problem/97/E\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/97/E\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["biconnected-components","odd cycle"]}}
