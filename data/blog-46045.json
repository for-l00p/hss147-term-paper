I submitted many times but it gave wrong answer with typecast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I submitted using 1ll in multiplication instead of typecast in this submission and it got accepted: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/697/submission/19150943\"\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/697/submission/19150943\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy question is why does typecasting not work and what is the difference between typecasting and 1ll?? Also when to use which because many of the solutions I coded before used typecasts and it worked well on various judges including Codeforces until I encountered this case for the first time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["gnu c++11"]}}
