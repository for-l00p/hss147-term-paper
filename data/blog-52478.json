Its rly smooth n delicious, if u want could be spicy or not, it can be either in solid or in liquid state!! Pls remembr tht the greatest shape of all is the ball shape so if u wanna be an ideal human u hav 2 giv ur stomach this God-blessed aliment. If u still arent intelligent enough 2 guess what i m talking about ill giv u a hint. Its as shiny as Kurt Cobains hair n its colour reminds me of my fav star i look at every day n if u r brave enough u can use it as a cream and then ur body will look hot as hell! In fact it could also fly but in basic form doesnt hav wings!!! Im sur tht my dear followers are very clever so its obvious tht what im talking bout is the one special ingredient and its our beloved butter! I hope u use it every day as its really delicious n healthy n all i want 4 u is 2 be healthy so pls eat butter!!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhats ur fav dish with butter? Let me know!
