I will be solving problems that are harder than my level to begin with. :) I might also make some posts about non popular topics ( i.e. DP D\u0026amp;C Trick — SPD ).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI might not have high rating to get you reading it but I will try to make it challenging/interesting as much as I can.
