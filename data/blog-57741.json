Hackerrank GS CodeSprint 2018 â€” Easy Problem!\u003c/p\u003e","locale":"en","content":"\u003cdiv class\u003d\"ttypography\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eDear coders,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast weekend, there was a Machine Learning contest on Hackerrank, namely GS CodeSprint 2018. It was my first time participating on a Machine Learning contest, so the result was horrible, but the important thing is: it is fun. During the contest, I only attempted to solve the easy problem, Car Popularity Prediction, but failed to solve it perfectly. It is simply a multi-classification problem: Given m features, map it to one of the 4 classes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI saw many people perfectly completed it. Therefore, I wonder if it is possible to share your approach? In my solution, what I did was to use a simple sklearn SVM and a grid search on C from 0.001 to 100. Only these few line of codes could get me 0.92. Run it a few more times and I get 0.94, but it was not possible to get 1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would be thankful if you can share with me what you have done to solve such problem perfectly. Thank you. Besides, is there anyone knowing how to resubmit the problem? I tried to resubmit but their server did not accept?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you for your time and consideration. I am looking forward to hearing from you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
