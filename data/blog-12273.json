Naturally, the Cormen Medal goes to the most productive and loved by many author of 2013, Sergey Nagin (\u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-orange\" href\u003d\"/profile/Sereja\" title\u003d\"Master Sereja\"\u003eSereja\u003c/a\u003e, Ukraine). Sergey prepared and conducted 7 rounds (all of them Div1+Div2) on Codeforces. Sergey\u0027s problems gained popularity among the Codeforces coders and we will be happy to see his contests again in the future!
