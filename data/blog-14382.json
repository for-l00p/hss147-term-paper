I think there is a knowledge gap(mathematics). I looked through the editorial too. But I cannot understand. I want to understand the solution. I even looked many of the submissions(using sparse tables, segment trees...). But staring the code doesn\u0027t seem to be beneficial(or may be I am too dumb for the problem). So, please help me solve this problem. I just want the idea. Thank you coders!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["problem solving"]}}
