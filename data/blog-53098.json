Can anybody please help me? My basic logic is that when the best left part and the best right part are both of the same element, then the parent node made from these two parts will have the best made of the same element and frequency equal to the sum of the best left and right frequencies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd if the best left and best right are not of the same element, then I\u0027ll check if the two child segments are internally joined by some common element. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCode: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ideone.com/uhftBt\"\u003ehttps://ideone.com/uhftBt\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["segment tree","advanced data structure","solution spoj"]}}
