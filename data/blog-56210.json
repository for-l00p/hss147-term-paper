As time goes on, I found that I could solve more and even all div2 problems, either on my own or by reading tutorials.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also got familiar with a lot of IDs as I kept participating in more virtual contests. At first, I competed with them together in div2 but they improved quite fast and went to div1, and as it turns out, they are legends now. But I guessed that before legends become legends, they had similar experiences like us, too, facing challenges, keeping practicing, handling various problems, and making progress day by day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis makes me believe more deeply, that hard working may not be sufficient to achieve one\u0027s target, but is at least surely necessary. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBest wishes to everyone\u0027s dream, and please never lose hope.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Finally, I strongly recommend this book \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/entry/50728\"\u003eCompetitive Programmer\u0027s Handbook â€” a new book on competitive programming\u003c/a\u003e, written by a great master, and hope that everyone can find something valuable there.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
