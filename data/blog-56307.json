I\u0027m trying to learn LCA. Firstly I learned LCA O(n) going up the nodes (u and v) linearly. After I learned LCA O(sqrt(n)) using sqrt-decomposition spliting the graph in buckets. Now I trying learning the LCA using Sparse Table, but I don\u0027t understand how this tecninque works. Someone can explain me, and shows the implementaion or pseude-code ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.S.: Sorry my english. LOL :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
