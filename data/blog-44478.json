But I have some confusion about \u003cstrong\u003echanging\u003c/strong\u003e the elements to v for all elements in the range [i,j] problem .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy question is , what is the general concept that I should have in mind while finding solution for these and more harder variations? I have seen lots of code online but they are mostly for the first version of the problem which I think I understand but I just don\u0027t know how to apply this concept to solve other variation of Lazy propagation problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd I also need some tips on debugging Segment tree problems.Thanks\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["segment tree","segment trees","lazy propagation","advanced data structure"]}}
