I found that i am able to solve A and B problems regularly in a contest and also solved the a2oj ladder. In case of C problems i am facing big difficulty as in most of them i am not able to think like the way of the solution, i am regularly practicing on a20j in div2 c category but still i am not able to think and have to see the solution. This is becoming kind of a habit with around 1 getting solved out of 5. Just wanted to know am i following the right path?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["general","coding practices"]}}
