It turns out that his code was wrong anyway, but I\u0027ve noticed one thing:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTake a look at these two submissions: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/16/submission/20042469\"\u003eTL\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/16/submission/20042471\"\u003eOK\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn both solutions I am using self-written vector class, but the difference between these two codes, obviously is that in the \u003cstrong\u003eOK\u003c/strong\u003e code I do not use the \u003ccode\u003edelete[]\u003c/code\u003e operator, thus it takes less time to destruct my class, but doesn\u0027t free the memory on destruction (which can be seen by memory taken by solution).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolutions take about this much time on my machine:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eNo vects:                  248ms\nVects with no destruction: 370ms\nVects with destruction:    948ms \n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe question stands: Why is delete[] operation so slow and where can I read about memory manager in c++? Google only leads me to things like \u0026quot;writing your own memory manager in c++\u0026quot; which is actually interesting, but unfortunately hard to read and that\u0027s not exactly the case I\u0027m looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
