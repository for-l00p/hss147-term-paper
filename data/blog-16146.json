I was able to successfuly ping google.com but i had 100% packet loss to facebook D:. I screenshoted everything to document what was happening and with just a minute left on the timer it started responding again! I tried downloading the input but I watched as it completely failed to download in time due to an extremely slow connection D:.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI submitted a feedback request asking for help and sent my code+the screenshots as proof and it appeared I would be recieving a manual judgement! :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSoon after the contest though I recieved the judgement that my soln was incorrect on a few cases D:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter correct code was accessible I compared my output to Gleb\u0027s to find my bug but my soln gave the same results (withing 2e-6) so I also compared to Anta\u0027s output with the same result. :S\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI sent off another email explaining this and a while ago recieved a response stating that there was a mistake in the manual judgement and \u0026quot;Sorry for the inconvenience you‘ve gone through. This solution puts you in 10th place overall, so we’ll be inviting you to the onsite finals :)\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e:D :D :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut unfortunately I am still 17 (I hadn\u0027t realised they were unaware of this) and so cannot attend this year D:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall quite the rollercoaster :D\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["hacker cup"]}}
