Suppose, I have several integer elements like this:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(3 9 1), (1 5 2), (2 8 3), (1 4 4), (1 6 5), (1 5 6).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow I want to sort the elements like vector of pairs are sorted. Only difference is that instead of 2 keys we have 3 keys here. After sorting the elements will look like:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(1 4 4), (1 5 2), (1 5 6), (1 6 5), (2 8 3), (3 9 1).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs there any STL or other techniques to achieve this? I found out about \u0026quot;Tuples\u0026quot; but having some problems to understand this well. Can you guys help me in any way please? May be by providing useful links or Explaining the process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks.. :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPD:\u003c/strong\u003e I got my ans here: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/50106878/6928946\"\u003ehttps://stackoverflow.com/a/50106878/6928946\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["pair","tuple","#sorting"]}}
