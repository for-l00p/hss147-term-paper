I\u0027m training for world-finals, sometimes simple printing values takes a lot of time and even worse, I end up changing the code and the final output gets messed up so it gets even more time to take it back to how it was. I mostly code in C++, and use Eclipse IDE and Geany editor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eany suggestions?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["worldfinals","debug","debugging","trace","c++","eclipse","geany"]}}
