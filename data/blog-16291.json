In recent times however it has seen an inflation to such a extent that it has become a real nuisance. What\u0027s worse is that now there have been increasing cases of spamming in blogs as well. If left unchecked , I fear that they might grow into a serious issues someday in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy solution to the problem is to follow the following steps:\u003c/p\u003e \u003col\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeople with a history of spamming comments should be banned from posting blogs or commenting. Alternatively people with a certain contribution (say -30 or less) shouldn\u0027t be allowed to comment or post blogs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnrated people shouldn\u0027t be allowed to comment or post a blog. A person has to attended a minimum of 4-5 contests to be eligible for commenting or posting a blog. This will ensure that people don\u0027t open fake accounts just for spamming. Also I think most people with less than 4 contests don\u0027t generally comment or post blogs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuggestions are welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
