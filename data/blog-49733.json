I had first solved a few of the problems on the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/2015-acm-acpc/challenges\"\u003eHackerrank instance\u003c/a\u003e before I found the official one, but when I tried submitting my code that solved the Hackerrank instance of them it would give WA on the ICPC OJ.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso it seems there are no successful submissions whatsoever to the whole contest on the whole OJ which seems suspicious. Does anyone know if the ICPC OJ is known for having wrong test cases?
