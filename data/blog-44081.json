Algorithms and DS I know are : Fenwick tree , Segment Tree , Graph Theory( except Flow algorithms ) , DP , Greedy ,String Algorithms( except Suffix Structures ), Two Pointer , Binary Search , usage of STLs . I am weak at number theory and math.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have solved around 800~ problems on various judges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy aim is probably to be a stable \u003cstrong\u003eCandidate master\u003c/strong\u003e ASAP and I am willing to do anything for it. So,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003eWhat am I doing wrong as I am unable to solve good problems still? What extra things I need to put in?\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eWhat can be a better approach to increase my knowledge and problem solving skills?\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eWhat are your suggestions?\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eShould I try practicing on other judges too as I only give contests on them till now?\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough I see most of the problems on 1000~ solutions in problemset are Div2D yet I sometimes fail at Div2C(last virtual contest)!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think the contest anxiety will subside slowly for sure as there are many rounds on CodeForces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGiven That\u003c/strong\u003e: I don\u0027t really have a coder\u0027s circle in my college with whom I can discuss harder problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want to know some more information about me to suggest something please Go on.
