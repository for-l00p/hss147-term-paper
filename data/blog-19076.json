Check it out! WTF is this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have read some post on CF discussing the difference about speed of cin/cout and scanf/printf. But how ever in general cases they talk about read integers. But it seems even if I add \u003ccode\u003eios :: sync_with_stdio(0);\u003c/code\u003e in my code, cin/cout is much slower than scanf/printf. Why is this? Anyone knows? Thx in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBTW, how can I share my code in gym so everybody can see it? (since gym has the rule U must got accepted first then U can read the others\u0027 code. However I remember once I saw a coder share his code in gym, but I don\u0027t need to got AC in advance.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["cin/cout","scanf/printf"]}}
