I created a contest in a2oj. Here is the link \u003ca href\u003d\"https://a2oj.com/contest?ID\u003d27599\"\u003ehttps://a2oj.com/contest?ID\u003d27599\u003c/a\u003e. The contest is gonna last many days(10+) with the purpose to practise in advanced graph/tree algorithms. Some of these algorithms are HLD, Centroid Decomp, Max flow, SCC, and other similar to graph/trees. I have already add some problems and you can register and start practising, but you are kindly request to send me problems via message or post them below, so I can add them in the contest. Problems that you already solved or no, it doesnt matter. In that way, each member will give a problem that maybe an other member hasnt solve it yet, so we can gather many problems to practise. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you !!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
