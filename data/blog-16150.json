Whenever I go to a problem\u0027s page for practicing, most of the time I look into the problem tag section accidentally which tells whether the problem is DP or greedy or graph,etc. And then I only think of solving the problem in that way. But, this is not the case during contests, since we have to breakdown the problem and find out if it is DP or greedy,etc. So, I want to practice in finding what kind of problem it is, and not knowing what approach to use to solve the problem before even reading the question sometimes.  So, is there any possible way to do this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["practice","problemset"]}}
