Tomorrow I have an official contest and I\u0027m facing the same problem. To prevent this from happening I intentionally slept only 3 hours last night to be tired enough to sleep today, and I was very tired and sleepy all day because of that, and now it\u0027s almost 12 PM and I can\u0027t sleep. Does this usually happen to you? Do you have any suggestions on how to prevent it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
