Problem D: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/552/problem/D\"\u003eThis\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis problem could be solved by simple O(n^3) by just picking all triplets and see if they make a triangle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell last year I calculated m1 \u003d (y[k] — y[j]) / (x[k] — x[j]) and calculated m2 \u003d (y[j] — y[i]) / (x[j] — x[i]) as doubles and if (m1 \u003d\u003d m2) then it\u0027s triangle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooking at the constraints n \u0026lt;\u003d 2000 so this answer should pass in the problem\u0027s time limit which is 4 seconds. But I got TLE.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis year while checking my previous solution, I decided to just convert the equation like this:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003d\u0026gt; m1 \u003d m2\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003d\u0026gt; (y[k] — y[j]) / (x[k] — x[j]) \u003d (y[j] — y[i]) / (x[j] — x[i])\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003d\u0026gt; (y[k] — y[j]) * (x[j] — x[i]) \u003d (y[j] — y[i]) * (x[k] — x[j])\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo now both l1 and l2 could be calculated as integers, I did this and AC. Wow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeems like double division in C++ takes time, while multiplication as integers is faster, that\u0027s why I got AC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrevious (TLE) Submission: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/552/submission/18887929\"\u003eSubmission 18887929\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCurrent (AC) Submission: \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/552/submission/18887986\"\u003eSubmission 18887986\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["double","c++","slow"]}}
