It would mean upvotes/downvotes are more genuine (less people upvoting reds blindly). It would mean that people are less likely to make many accounts to downvote out of hate. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStackOverflow, for example, doesn\u0027t allow users to upvote or downvote unless they have a certain amount of positive contribution. I\u0027m not saying we should do this, but I\u0027m just showing how it can work in practice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, I know this isn\u0027t a new idea and I\u0027m not saying it is perfect.
