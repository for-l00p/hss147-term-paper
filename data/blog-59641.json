After reading about \u003cstrong\u003ebaby step giant step\u003c/strong\u003e algorithm on \u003cem\u003eWikipedia\u003c/em\u003e, I became little bit confused and some questions came a cross on my mind. Then, I passed my next 7 days by searching on google to get my answers about \u003cstrong\u003eBSGS\u003c/strong\u003e. But I didn\u0027t find anything helpful. After that, I wrote a post on our CSE department\u0027s facebook group about my questions and had a conversation with my senior brother of CSE department \u003cstrong\u003eShakil\u003c/strong\u003e vai about my those questions and got my desired answers. Now, I\u0027m going to upload those screenshots in here. It can be helpful to others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/9f/a6/9fa6ce2389f07a1d51ec8a15ad5d57f4ca27f4a4.jpg\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e \u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/ae/94/ae94f7c9edf5f3a6ae6a917d4ecf96b2e8635612.jpg\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e \u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/dd/54/dd548c54351d1ae3e9e81bff675c15f26ba73a54.jpg\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHappy Coding everyone! :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#baby-step-giant-step","#algorithms"]}}
