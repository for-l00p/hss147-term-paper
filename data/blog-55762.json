Does anyone maybe have a list with such problems of DP, but with some log N optimization, for example N^2 -\u0026gt; NlogN or N^3 -\u0026gt; N^2logN. Any problems would help, preferably from Codeforces Div 2 C-E level. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
