Tutorials like \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/blog/PrinceOfPersia\"\u003eAlgorithm Gym\u003c/a\u003e By \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-orange\" href\u003d\"/profile/PrinceOfPersia\" title\u003d\"Master PrinceOfPersia\"\u003ePrinceOfPersia\u003c/a\u003e should not be lost between other blog posts. I think Codeforces should have a pinned tutorials tab in its navbar. This Tutorials page should contain links to verified tutorials on Codeforces, something that\u0027s exactly like \u003ca href\u003d\"http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module\u003dStatic\u0026amp;d1\u003dtutorials\u0026amp;d2\u003dalg_index\"\u003eTopcoder\u0027s tutorials\u003c/a\u003e but for Codeforces. I guess this will encourage more people to write tutorials with the motive of getting them added to this tutorials archive. I searched before posting this idea but I didn\u0027t find any post that suggests something like this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["tutorials","codeforces","archive"]}}
