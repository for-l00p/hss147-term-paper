The statement translates to — find number of ways to divide a number \u0027m\u0027 into \u0027n\u0027 distinct positive numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1\u0026lt;\u003dm,n\u0026lt;\u003d10^6 also, m*n\u0026lt;\u003d10^6\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was thinking of applying dp, but was stuck at it because it required all the numbers to be distinct. It is obvious that for all values of \u0027n\u0027 around 1400 and above, answer is 0.But that didn\u0027t help me in my approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan dp be applied? Or could it be solved using other method?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEDIT: Solved using dp — consider a list of numbers — 1,2,3,....n (minimum possible) and at each index i,increment all numbers (i to n) by some constant.Apply dp here. I still faced some time complexity issues — \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/yXCYeo\"\u003ehttp://ideone.com/yXCYeo\u003c/a\u003e I had to optimise it using sieve — \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ideone.com/jpHIlR\"\u003ehttp://ideone.com/jpHIlR\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease let me know if you used some other method.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["spoj"]}}
