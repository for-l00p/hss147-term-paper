What if I use list instead of a vector. I mean it\u0027s O(1) to add an edge in the list similar to vector(amortized) also it\u0027s O(n) to check if there is an edge between two vertices in both vector and list. I have seen most people using vector instead of list. Are there any performance costs associated with lists compared to vector?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTHANK YOU :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
