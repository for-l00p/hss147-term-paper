Google Translate could only do so much for the page (the only solution I could find), but I think I was able to discern the following from the code:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1) The array \u0026quot;per\u0026quot; reverses the permutation process, and length of 31 represents a bitmask of that length,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2) The idea behind the \u0026quot;per\u0026quot; is that the result of a number of consecutive permutations can be assembled in logarithmic time, and\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3) The variable \u0026quot;num\u0026quot; in the third main loop functions as a mask.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, I do not fully understand the purpose of \u0026quot;bot\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;now\u0026quot;, and \u0026quot;k\u0026quot; in the third main loop, and the mathematics in the first and third main loops.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would appreciate an explanation for these parts of the solution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["usaco","adhoc"]}}
