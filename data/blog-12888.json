It seems to me like test data (answers, to be precise) in problems \u0027Guess My Word\u0027 and \u0027Table Coloring\u0027 are broken. I have three solutions from three different people for the latter problem and they produce the same answers for tests 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 â€” zero, while the reference answer is non-zero. For the \u0027Guess my Word\u0027 problem I have two solutions: one fast and one brute-force with memoization which I wrote by myself several minutes ago. These two solutions produce same output on tests 1-16, but they both produce \u0027No\u0027 on some test cases where official test data says \u0027Yes\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoes anyone have information about validity of this test data or some solutions which I can test with too?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["apio","apio 2011","test data"]}}
