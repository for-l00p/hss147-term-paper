The problem is pretty straightforward. Some people generated all Lucky Numbers less than 1000. Some people excluded 44 (as any number divisible by 44 would be divisible by 4), 77, 444, etc. The real problem is in the very weak system test. Only 36 test cases! :v o.O . A simple wrong code like \u003ca href\u003d\"/contest/122/submission/10057587\" title\u003d\"Submission 10057587 by Nassef\"\u003e10057587\u003c/a\u003e got AC, although, it outputs \u0026quot;NO\u0026quot; for 954 which is divisible by 477. Generally, are there a lot of such weak system test?! does this affect the fairness of the contest?!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["91"]}}
