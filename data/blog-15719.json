Most of the time, I open tabs for problems I want to solve, and I usually can\u0027t solve all of them; these stack and lead to a lot of ugly opened tabs that I can\u0027t close. Of course, I can use an external to-do app, notebook etc. to list the problems I want to solve, but it\u0027s not as good as a built-in feature. I think that it would be great to have something like that also on codeforces. What do you think?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["to-do list","sitedesign","feature request"]}}
