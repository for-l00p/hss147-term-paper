The contest is open and the registration page is \u003ca href\u003d\"http://evaluator.hsin.hr/login.php?redirect\u003dindex.php\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e (while \u003ca href\u003d\"http://hsin.hr/coci/\"\u003ethis page\u003c/a\u003e contains a redirect to the registration, along with their past problemsets).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe competition should be close to IOI style; It seems to contain ~4 problems and from what I understood, has a duration of 5 hours. A big difference is that there is no full feedback during the contest: every submission is only tested on the samples provided during the contest (I would expect them to change this format for COI but it doesn\u0027t seem to be the case).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGood luck! Let\u0027s discuss the problems and the solutions here after the contest ends :).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
