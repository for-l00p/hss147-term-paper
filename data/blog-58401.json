I request you to take a quick look at the code and let me know, it will be a big help! Thanks a lot!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePS- I used segment tree to store sum, maximum prefix sum, maximum suffix sum and maximum subarray sum in a segment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEdit:- Nevermind, I found the mistake. I was initialising a node with all four variable values as LLONG_MIN which should\u0027t have been done because adding a negative number to that will cause overflow. Also, in build function I forgot the start\u0026gt;end case.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["spoj","gss1","sigsegv","help needed","segment tree"]}}
