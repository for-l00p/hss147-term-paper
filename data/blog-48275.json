For my surprise, in those two problems, I received TLE as a verdict on really small testcases when using GNU C++11 as a language. The solutions for those tests were running pretty fast on my machine, so I decided to submit them with GNU C++14; surprisingly, those solutions were accepted, having really small execution time on the said tests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProblem 1:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/468/submission/22086403\"\u003eC++11\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/468/submission/22086406\"\u003eC++14\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProblem 2:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/406/submission/22104599\"\u003eC++11\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/406/submission/22104609\"\u003eC++14\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat is the issue?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAppreciate the help!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["tle","c++11","c++14"]}}
