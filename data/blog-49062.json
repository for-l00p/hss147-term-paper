All I wanted is just participate in contests, join the community, comment, and learn. But what I receive usually downvotes for no reason at all. I got downvotes because of some stupid comments, well I think I can accept that. But then I commented \u0026quot;C is really interesting :D\u0026quot; about the problem C from the previous contest. It\u0027s just an expression, a feeling for the problem, harmless and not even a stupid comment then I got -17 downvotes or even more. Well I guess it doesn\u0027t matter anymore I will also get tons of downvotes from this entry anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["to community"]}}
