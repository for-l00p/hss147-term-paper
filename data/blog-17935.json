I\u0027m struggling with a problem and I hope you can help me. You have a matrix of n x m elements between 1 and 10 000( n \u0026lt;\u003d 100 , m \u0026lt;\u003d 100 ). You have to find the maximum area of a submatrix with at most k distinct elements. What\u0027s the best complexity you can get? O(n^3) ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["problem","matrix","codeforces"]}}
