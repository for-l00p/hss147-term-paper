I Found this: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-s10/www/lectures/lect0423.txt\"\u003ehttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-s10/www/lectures/lect0423.txt\u003c/a\u003e. and it was really helpful to understand its nature, there is given algorithm in pseudo-C too, but I don\u0027t know how to implement it in C or C++. Can you suggest to me clean impelementation of FFT, where the inputs are two polynomials and output is multiplication of them?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["fft","math","c++"]}}
