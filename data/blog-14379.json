You are allowed to rearrange its rows. What is the maximum area of the submatrix that only consists of ones and can be obtained in the given problem by the described operations?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProblem link: \u003ca\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/contest/375/problem/B\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTutorial Link: \u003ca\u003ehttp://codeforces.com/blog/entry/10084\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am having problem understanding the solution. It uses a right[i][j]\u003dnumber of continuous 1s to the right of input[j][i] and then sorts the right matrix along the columns. I\u0027m not sure how this works. Does sorting according to columns arrives at a particular permutation of rows? How does this work?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["algorithms","div.1","matrix"]}}
