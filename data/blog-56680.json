So, if you know any good construction problems, which you enjoyed solving or learnt something new through it, please drop a link to them in the comment section.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you are confused about what kind of problem I am looking for, well, the problem should contain some restrictions and it should ask to build some array, matrix, tree, graph, etc. meeting those restrictions. It can be from any judge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["construction","constructive algorithms","suggest some problem","noob"]}}
