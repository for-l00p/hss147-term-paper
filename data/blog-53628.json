I got it right on the second attempt though.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/contest/811/problem/B\"\u003eB.

Unfortunately, it got hacked in a few minutes :-/.\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the contest ended, I went through the editorial ( quickly understood how I could fix the time complexity bottleneck ) and quickly coded up the solution, got AC !! \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eRESULT : \u003cstrong\u003eSPECIALIST\u003c/strong\u003e__ (1404) ( seems like codeforces rating system rewards newbies generously ) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReflection :\u003c/strong\u003e :\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eTry to read and understand questions quick, keeping in mind the corner cases, and touch the keyboard only after you\u0027re convinced that you\u0027ve thought of all possible corner cases\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the solution that you\u0027ve thought of would get a TLE , due to the constraints of the problem, then don\u0027t push your luck. Producing a solution not keeping in mind the constraints is as good as not submitting a solution ( it\u0027s even worse, as you lose points as penalty )\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first 2 problems are doable by me (considering my present skill level ), as they do not require any algorithmic/ data structure knowledge. Just implementation skill and the skill to spot a pattern / reduce time complexity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other problems C ,D ,E , do requre algorithmic knowledge... I\u0027ll get there once I study up those Algo\u0027s and have enough practice to be able to attempt them in competitions. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["first round","#for_beginners"]}}
