The list of TopCoder\u0027s contests is so long that I am unable to normally enter whichever practice room I want, because corresponding buttons are shown by arena in a place that is not visible on my screen :). For some time just dragging arena to top of screen was doing the job, but it is no longer sufficient :P. Am I the only one facing this issue or maybe it is device-specific or maybe I am just a retard and I am missing some easy solution? In order to enter practice room for SRM 686 I used navigation by arrows, but it is just a temporary hacky workaround.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"/predownloaded/23/f7/23f750d09bca8088bf787dbffac2ac6ba2f85553.jpg\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["topcoder","arena","does","it","again"]}}
