I often have trouble with does kind of questions because I am not always sure whether the order of operations matters and what operations matter. What is your usual approach when you see such kind of problem and how do you find out the properties of the operations and the structure you are doing it on so quickly?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#dynamic-programming","#atcoder"]}}
