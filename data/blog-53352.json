Does anyone know how to implement constraints of the following type into a system?\n\nEdges 1 and 2 go into the vertex, and have capacity one. Edges 3 and 4 go out and have capacity one. How can one force a constraint to the effect of (edges 3 and 2 can\u0027t have a sum of flows greater than one)? \n\nUPD: I should note the context involves min-cost flow, so perhaps we can leverage the costs of the edges.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
