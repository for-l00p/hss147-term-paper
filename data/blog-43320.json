Someone aware of how to make such I/O on the JS?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eExamining the global runtime object I found methods \u003cstrong\u003eread\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eload\u003c/strong\u003e and according to their errors they are trying to interact with the file system. But I get failed to make them work. There is also an \u003cstrong\u003eos\u003c/strong\u003e object but he seems to be empty. So if anyone has faced this problem â€” share your experience, please\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
