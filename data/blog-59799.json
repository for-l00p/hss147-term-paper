Subway\u003c/a\u003e problem. I have to find a cicle. Initially I thought that by implementing tarjan algorithm I could find the cycle (I tried it and I can\u0027t imagine it in an unmanaged graph), but maybe it would be easier to go through it with bfs and store the nodes that I am visiting in a set if they are not in the set . If it means that the nodes of the set are the cycle that I am looking for. Is this correct?. Is there a more efficient way and how can I implement it? Thank you\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["#graph","tarjan","bfs","#graphs"]}}
