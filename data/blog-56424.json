The UI there is too complicated and I can\u0027t understand. Also some people mention about an \u0027applet\u0027 to solve. Whats that? I tried to Google search but only got links on how to start competitive programming on topcoder. (As in read problems think algo solve etc...). But how does one navigate and solve actual questions?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["topcoder","beginner","how to start"]}}
