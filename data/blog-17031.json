How do you give a shot to debugging segment tree solution in general ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso every blog i read about Segment Tree ,they pictured Segment Tree of 2^n elements which is simple but i really dont know how to picture up Segment Tree formed out k nodes where k!\u003d2^n :/ Can leafs of such a tree be at different heights ? I mean when i print out my ST linearly is it necessary for leaves to be in same order as the original array from which i constructed segment tree?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThnksy in adv ^_^\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["segment tree","debugging"]}}
