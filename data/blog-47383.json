I\u0027ve matched all the test cases mentioned there. I\u0027ve tried so many different precisions, still WA :(\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn my code, if I reduces the angle I am rotating with, precision increases whereas I get TLE, and vice versa. I am getting no way around it :( My idea is to binary search on the dividing line as I rotate the polygon. Please someone help. I have already tried it for nearly a whole day and I feel like banging my head right now :/\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance...\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
