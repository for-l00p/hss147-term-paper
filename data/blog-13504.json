I solved just 40 so I\u0027m pretty disappointed. On a more optimistic note , I saw at myself a some improvement during constests ( hope you did it too ) , so that\u0027s a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am not sure how useful is the group and , as a result , I invite you to comment this post to see if it\u0027s worthed to continue or not.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor The September Challenge I propose to make 20 CF div2 simulations. I consider this a hard objective as the school or college begins for the most of us. The real challenge is to see if you can work constantly. As in The August Challenge I\u0027ll make some standings table and I invite you to write down your mistakes \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/group/AgZcF7f0rX/blog/entry/203\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. I will add into group contests section 20 first div2 rounds after CF#100 ( no problem if you solved them , just simulate others ).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI observed that at some of the old editorials are questions not answered , so we will try to respond if you have questions regading the problems in simulated rounds here. Moreover at \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-blue\" href\u003d\"/profile/caioaao\" title\u003d\"Expert caioaao\"\u003ecaioaao\u003c/a\u003e\u0027s initiative it will be added a \u003ca href\u003d\"//codeforces.com/group/AgZcF7f0rX/blog/entry/201#comment-181253\"\u003enew\u003c/a\u003e entry with motivational purposes. Also a new post about our weak areas will be made so we can choose problems that are useful for the most in November.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn ending of this post I announce that the entrys will be added on first of September if the feedback is positive and you are still willing to continue with the group. All of you are welcomed with new ideas in comments and just PM me if you want to write an entry or add some contest. Thanks for taking The Challenge and have a nice day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePS : I will be gone next week so I\u0027ll see the feedback and PMs on the first of September.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
