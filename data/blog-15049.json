However the logic behind the solutions i read its pretty unclear to me, and since there is not outline at all, i decided to ask for the help of the CF community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOk, so instead of dropping the link to the statement i\u0027ll explain the problem, you are given a set of points (which are less than 1000 points), your task is to tell in how many ways you can combine those points to make an isosceles triangle (no three points are collinear) . I have found many problems that follow this concept, and they just change the number of vertices, so i am pretty sure i want to understand the solution to the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eif you can help me, that would be great, thanks! :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["geometry","counting","question","problem","acm 2009"]}}
