I am Vietnamese. I write this blog to talk about the time of contests in Codeforces. As you know, almost contests on Codeforces begin at 19:00 in Russian, so that is 23:30 in Vietnam. It\u0027s very hard for coders in Vietnam and many other countries. Because that\u0027s too tired to take part in. I don\u0027t ask to change time of contests to another time. I just want to find some ways to make more easier for me and other people like me. Are there anyone has idea about this problem ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is my idea : \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe can create a long contest like USACO but the duration is shorter (maybe 7-8 hours) and each person can choose their approriate time to take part in, but everyone just only has 2,5 hours (or ...) to solve all of the problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m glad to hearing other ideas from you. Share your idea to make Codeforces better! \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["contest time","#contest"]}}
