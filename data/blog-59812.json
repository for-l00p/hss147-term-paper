I just want to inquire about something. why in educational rounds and div3 rounds there are no points for problems I think this is unfair, especially since it has become rated for div2 , It makes no sense that someone solved a and b problems to be ranked above others who solved c problem and higher because they got a mistake in one of their (a,b) problems after the contest is over , Please explain to me why the system of such rounds are like that and why they couldn\u0027t put points for the problems. thanks for reading :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
