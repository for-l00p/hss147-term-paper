Then I realise that, my friend who is also took part in this contest, he found that the problems were too tough for him, then he decided to \u003cstrong\u003ecopy code\u003c/strong\u003e from the other in order to \u003cstrong\u003eSkip\u003c/strong\u003e his contest result.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is the point: It\u0027s not fair, because even the round is hard but with this \u003cstrong\u003eSkip\u003c/strong\u003e trick, you won\u0027t get decrease in rating. I wish CF may fix this problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuggestion: the \u003cstrong\u003eSkip\u003c/strong\u003e users should get some kind of penalties such as decrease rating or point, or ban them from few contests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
