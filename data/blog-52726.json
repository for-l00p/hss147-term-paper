Many other people have done the same thing. I believe that they have made the DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph) of LIS problem\u0027s subproblems and have done something using it . I know how to find LIS using standard O(n^2) DP and also in O(nlogn) using binary search but i am not able to optimize it for range query .
