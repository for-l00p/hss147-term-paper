When we can see the visualize effect of any algorithm then we can feel its aesthetic beauty which is not describable in mere words. Recently I came to see simulation of watercolor on 2d bitmap in android. The algorihm used for the simulation was Lattice Boltzmann\u0027s method for 2d dynamics. \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~billbao/report930.pdf\"\u003eLattice Boltzmann\u003c/a\u003e . \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe visual effect was pretty awesome but unfortunately the performance was poor, it was kind of laggy. I went through some applications to see the watercolor simulation effect. I\u0027ve tried a wonderful and well known app in android for drawing like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id\u003dcom.ambientdesign.artrage.playstore\u0026amp;hl\u003den\"\u003eArtRage\u003c/a\u003e. But still the simulation was slow. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve found some optimization of LatticeBoltzmann method \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www10.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/Publications/Theses/2005/Dreweke_BA_05.pdf\"\u003eOptimization\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan anyone please share his/her experience with fluid simulation algorithms and any optimizations / fast implementation to Lattice Boltzmann method.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["fluid simulation","2d bitmap","lattice boltzmann method"]}}
