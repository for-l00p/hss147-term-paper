I am unable to figure out my mistake. Could someone please take a look at it and guide me in the right direction, if they can figure out what my mistake is?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy logic is as follows: I used a n^2 algorithm. One by one, I selected each edge as the one I will delete and found the optimal vertices in the two trees created (optimal means has the least sum of distances to other vertices in the same tree). Then I join those two to get the answer and compare it with the global answer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
