We have to find a subtree of this graph that has minimal weight and contains Q. Now, this is a \u0026quot;famous\u0026quot; NP problem, but I thought what if the graph was unweighted, or alternatively all edges have the same weight? Is this problem easier or has the same complexity?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["graph"]}}
