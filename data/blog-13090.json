In particular, we have exercises about context-free grammars. It would be great if you take a look to it. Next July 30 from 14h to 16h (+1GMT) we will organize a global exam (like a contest) about context-free grammars. It would be very nice if you take part on it. Also, if you are interested in preparing a specific global exam on this subject, now the site allows the introduction of new exercises by any user (we can insert your exercises in a future exam if you mark them as private). Inserting a new exercise is very easy: it is not necessary to give a set of tests, just a statement (in latex) and a correct solution (a context-free grammar).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["online judge","grammars","contest"]}}
