Now you have to select 10 stations(means 10 hops) among those 100 stations in such a way that maximum of distance between any 2 hops will be minimised. By default 1 and 100 stations are selected , so you need to choose only 8 more stations. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eHere n\u003d100 I have chosen but n can be large( so bruteforce won\u0027t work ).\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["dynamic programming","binary search"]}}
