I have noticed that you\u0027re no longer able to view the complete user submission history (either normally or via signed list) for any user apart from yourself. This is an impediment. I personally look up to a few users and solve problems that they\u0027re solving( I\u0027m sure there are many others like me) and also see what order the top/popular users have solved the problems in, this also spares me the trouble of spending time on finding good/challenging problems on SPOJ.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI kindly request \u0026quot;top\u0026quot; users of SPOJ or just about anyone who has done a lot of SPOJ (a lot of means arbitrary lets just put 300-400+) and benefited from it to \u0026quot;try\u0026quot; and post their submission history (You could put your own signed list in a text file and host it on pastebin). It would be extremely helpful for newbie coders and for anyone who does a lot of SPOJ by following what other solve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.S. I have also sent a mail to SPOJ explaining my predicament.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["spoj","submissions list"]}}
