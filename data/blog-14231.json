I\u0027ve already tried three different solutions, using Hash, Aho-Corasick and Suffix Array (O(n) implementation + Longest Common Prefix) respectively. However, I keep getting TLE, as the time limit is too tight and they don\u0027t use optimization flags to compile on this site.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNotice that this problem is also available on \u003ca href\u003d\"https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?option\u003dcom_onlinejudge\u0026amp;Itemid\u003d8\u0026amp;page\u003dshow_problem\u0026amp;problem\u003d2812\"\u003eLiveArchive\u003c/a\u003e.
