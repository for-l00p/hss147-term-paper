But people in some other regions take slots as granted. They don\u0027t care at all about WF. They think that qualifying for WF is a lifetime achievement, why bother practicing, let\u0027s enjoy the tour instead. So, they don\u0027t even stand under rank 50, for years after years!! Participants from these regions continuously perform poorly. So, I think it is better if their slot was decreased so that they would be motivated to perform better next time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
