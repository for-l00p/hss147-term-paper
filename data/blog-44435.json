You will have two hours to solve six problems. After that you will have one day to hack any solution you want. You will have access to copy any solution and test it locally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have ideas for some problems or maybe already prepared problems that you can\u0027t use in rounds or official competitions, you can write to me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt seems that it is harder to invent interesting simple problems (like A and B) than difficult ones. So don\u0027t be afraid to suggest interesting simple or very simple tasks (of course the difficult tasks are also needed). Please send only the problems for which you know the solution with clear statement (the story is not required). And also please add one or two samples to make the problem statement more clear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problemset was suggested by Codeforces users (it\u0027s time to lift this sentence inside the tegs).
