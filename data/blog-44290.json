However, I am having a bit of trouble as there are no solutions to starred (difficult) questions (For easy one, there are very clear answers, I wonder why?). I wonder if there are any official or unofficial sources where I can find some hints to these difficult questions?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother question is that, has anyone tried this website? (By Mr. Halim too)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/methodstosolve.html\"\u003ehttps://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/methodstosolve.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is said to contain hints to many problems. However, I have found no ways to see these hints. Clicking on the hint button (?) does not return anything. Is there anyone knowing how to use it or it really does contain nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCould you please help me? Thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
