I am very weak in Math. Generally i try to skip any problem or editorial that is related to math. It is very hard to me to understand any Explanation that use a lot of math. When i see any editorial i just try to figure out what happened rather than why happened. After completing reading i think i have got it. But after few time when i ask myself Am I really got it? Then i realize No, I just memorized it. I don\u0027t know why i have this tendency to mathematical problems. Of course i didn\u0027t have this tendency before. At my early age i loved math very much. I found its ammaizing and interesting. But then there is big gap and now i found that i have fear about it. Can I overcome this fear? Any Suggestion please. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny web or any book or some interesting/funny problems that will teach me how to think.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSorry for my bad English.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
