I just wanna ask why did my rating became \u0027pupil\u0027 yesterday. I wasn\u0027t able to solve atleast one problem in div2 yesterday. I was expecting that my rank will became a \u0027newbie\u0027. I\u0027m not really good at programming so I was really shocked when my rank became \u0027pupil\u0027. Can someone explain this dilemma to me? I would appreciate it. Thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
