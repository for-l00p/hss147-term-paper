I am describing what is the problem about .There are debt relations given among n guilds in a matrix . i.e : a[i][j] will describe the amount owed by guild i to guild j . It is necessarily given that a[i][j]\u003d-a[j][i] . Now the guilds which owe more that they are to receive start going bankrupt . After this operation all the debt relations of this guild are cancelled. They are not to receive money nor they owe it to anyone. When this happens many guilds start going bankrupt . In this sequence we need to determine if guild i could be last one standing or not . \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ewe need to check for each guild if it could be last one standing , so how do we check that . If we start from any guild there are many possible ways the order of bankrupcy may go , hence I am not able to figure out how to check that . Or is there any other approach to this problem . Here n \u0026lt;\u003d20 and a[i][j]\u0026lt;\u003d10^6 . TIA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
