It turns out that Polygon development system is the perfect tool for this kind of job, and I want to use the system in real contest too. The problem is that during the contest, participants are not allowed to access internet. I\u0027m afraid to use PC^2 system because of several reasons:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e   \u003cli\u003eNo multiple input files: All input files should be concentrated to one file\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eNo checker. Actually it\u0027s possible to use a checker, but one has to write judgement in XML format or run the checker manually (I\u0027m not 100% sure about it).\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eIt\u0027s hard to configure the system\u003c/li\u003e   \u003cli\u003eSometimes the system clogs up judge computer\u0027s memory. Two years before we had to reset the whole system because computer couldn\u0027t handle too much memory load.\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe I misused the PC^2 system, but still I\u0027d strongly prefer Polygon/Gym system. Can I use it while keeping every participants away from the internet(maybe except for contest page)? Participants\u0027 PC are connected to a main router. I\u0027m really a noob when it comes to system configuring/networking stuff, so any kind answer will be appreciated. If there\u0027s another judgement system that is easy to use, you can suggest it too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["polygon","judge","local contest"]}}
