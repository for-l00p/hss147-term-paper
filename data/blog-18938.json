I looked the editorial and found out that it was solvable through Treaps, a data structure i never heard of. I just wanted to ask what are the advanced data structures am i missing? It will be great help if anyone of you would list the important ds for the competitive contests. Here are some ds , i am aware of : 1.Array 2.List 3.Stack 4.Queue 5.Binary Tree 6.BST 7.Heap 8.Hash 9.Segment Tree( 1D only ) 10.Graphs\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.S It will be helpful if you could list the missing ds with their tutorial links or study material. P.S Positive responses are appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["data structures","advanced data structure"]}}
