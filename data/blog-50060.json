I would like a solution which runs in at most 1 hour or so. Can someone give me an idea? Thank you! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFind all permutations a such that a has 28 elements and:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ea has 8 cycles of length 3 and 4 fixed points b is ({1,2,3...,7}, {8,9,10...,14}, {15,16,17...,21}, {22,23,24,...,28}) cycle structure a * b has 14 cycles of length 2. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":["permutation"]}}
