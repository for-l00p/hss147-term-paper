When you copy someone\u0027s source code during the contest, your problem will get SKIPPED and you will not get any points, the contest will become unrated for you. I think it is not fair, because if you submitted a problem and it was not correct, you can just copy your friend\u0027s code and you will not lose any points. I think this should be fixed !!! \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-admin\" href\u003d\"/profile/MikeMirzayanov\" title\u003d\"Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov\"\u003eMikeMirzayanov\u003c/a\u003e do you know about this?
