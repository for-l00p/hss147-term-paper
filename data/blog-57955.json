Can anybody point me to a more detailed explanation of this technique?? or maybe some problems here in codeforces solvable using it ??\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePD: I have seen this technique in the dynamic version of convex hull trick, maybe simpler problems can help me to understand the approach.
