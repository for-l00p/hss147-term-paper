I usually prove it either by visualization or studying the how many times we end up summing the line segments between each two consecutive points.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAre there any simpler more elegant proofs ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShow us how beautiful your minds are :D! \u003cimg alt\u003d\" \" src\u003d\"http://basementrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/beautiful-mind-2001-movie-review-john-nash-window-equations-russell-crowe.jpg\" style\u003d\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
