You are given binary string a and b where 1 \u0026lt;\u003d length(a) \u0026lt;\u003d length(b) \u0026lt;\u003d 10^5. Let length(a) \u003d n. Now we are required to find the smallest binary-valued substring S of b with length n where XOR(S, a) is minimum. I thought a solution with bitsets which may avoid TL, but i couldn\u0027t made it up. Can anybody help me to solve this, please?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eExample: Input: 1101 1011000 Output: 1100\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
