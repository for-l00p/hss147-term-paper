The summarized form of the problem is as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are T testcases. In each testcase You are Given an array of size N and Q queries. (N,Q\u0026lt;\u003d10^5).Array elements\u0026lt;\u003d10^9 In each query you are given range [L,R] and a set of distinct integers lying in range [1,10]. Now for each query you have to report no. of elements in range [L,R] which are divisible by atleast one element from the set.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy approach:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am storing a 2D prefix sum array which tells the no. of elements divisible by X(1\u0026lt;\u003dX\u0026lt;\u003d10) in range [L,R]. Now for a given query I am generating all subsets of elements in the set and then using inclusion-exclusion principle to find the numbers divisible by atleast 1 element from set. But getting TLE . \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease Suggest some optimization or some other approach to this problem Thanks in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[]}}
